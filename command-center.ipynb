The purpose of the study is a comprehensive assessment of the potential benefits and risks of introducing AI into education in terms of their impact on sustainable development. Tasks include: identification of key AI application opportunities to improve the quality, accessibility, and inclusivity of education (SDG 4); analysis of issues related to ethics, algorithm bias, digital inequality, and the need for retraining; assessment of the impact of AI on the formation of competencies necessary for a sustainable future. The results show the significant potential of AI in personalizing learning, automating routine tasks, and providing access to knowledge, but also reveal serious risks of exacerbating social inequality (SDG 10) and ethical dilemmas. The scientific novelty lies in the systematic consideration of the relationship between the introduction of AI in education and the achievement of the SDGs, offering a balanced view of the challenges and opportunities. The practical significance lies in the formulation of recommendations for policy makers, educators, and developers on responsible and sustainability-oriented implementation of AI in educational systems.', 'authors': ['S.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians‚Äô expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE‚Äôs performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM‚Äìpatient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.', 'authors': ['Tao Tu', 'M.

Reporting guidelines need to be updated to take into account this advance. The SCARE Guideline 2025 update adds a new AI-focused domain to promote transparency, reproducibility, and ethical integrity in surgical case reports involving AI.\\n\\nMethods: A Delphi consensus exercise was conducted to update the SCARE guidelines. A panel of 49 surgical and scientific experts were invited to rate proposed new items. In round 1, participants scored each item on a 9-point Likert scale and provided feedback. Items not meeting consensus were revised or discarded.\\n\\nResults: A 94% response rate occurred amongst participants (46/49) in the first round. Ratings were analysed for agreement levels, and consensus was reached on all six proposed AI-related items. A revised SCARE checklist is presented which incorporates these new AI related items. Authors are now expected to disclose AI involvement not only in patient care but also in manuscript preparation, as exemplified by this paper.\\n\\nConclusion: The SCARE 2025 guideline provides an up-to-date framework for surgical case reports in the era of AI. Through a robust consensus process, we have added specific reporting criteria for AI to ensure that any use of artificial intelligence in a case report is clearly documented, explained and discussed including with respect to bias and ethics. This update will help maintain the quality, transparency, and clinical relevance of case reports, ultimately improving their educational value and trustworthiness for the surgical community.', 'authors': ['Ahmed Kerwan', 'A.

Nonetheless, the inherent visual similarities between benign and malignant lesions pose substantial challenges to accurate classification. To overcome these obstacles, this study proposes an innovative hybrid deep learning model that combines ConvNeXtV2 blocks and separable self-attention mechanisms, tailored to enhance feature extraction and optimize classification performance. The inclusion of ConvNeXtV2 blocks in the initial two stages is driven by their ability to effectively capture fine-grained local features and subtle patterns, which are critical for distinguishing between visually similar lesion types. Meanwhile, the adoption of separable self-attention in the later stages allows the model to selectively prioritize diagnostically relevant regions while minimizing computational complexity, addressing the inefficiencies often associated with traditional self-attention mechanisms. The model was comprehensively trained and validated on the ISIC 2019 dataset, which includes eight distinct skin lesion categories. Advanced methodologies such as data augmentation and transfer learning were employed to further enhance model robustness and reliability. The proposed architecture achieved exceptional performance metrics, with 93.48% accuracy, 93.24% precision, 90.70% recall, and a 91.82% F1-score, outperforming over ten Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based and over ten Vision Transformer (ViT) based models tested under comparable conditions.

As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they were last year.\", 'authors': ['Nick Craswell', 'Bhaskar Mitra', 'Emine Yilmaz', 'Daniel Fernando Campos', 'Jimmy Lin', 'E.

Traditional rule-based systems are increasingly inadequate in identifying fraudulent patterns, especially with the advent of more complex and subtle fraud strategies. This study explores state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit card fraud detection systems. Various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are evaluated using a publicly available credit card transaction dataset. Emphasis is placed on the importance of handling class imbalance, which is a critical issue in fraud detection, by employing techniques like SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning. Feature engineering and data preprocessing play vital roles in improving model performance, and these are rigorously addressed in the methodology. Performance is assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to ensure balanced evaluation. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly LSTM and CNNs, outperform traditional machine learning techniques in capturing temporal and spatial transaction patterns. However, the choice of algorithm may vary depending on the computational resources and the real-time nature of deployment. The proposed system integrates the most effective models into a hybrid framework that balances accuracy and efficiency.

However, few studies have attempted to establish the complex relationship between visible damage and structural conditions. Moreover, the lack of training data further hinders the potential use of deep learning algorithms. This paper proposes a framework, termed Bidirectional Graphics-based Digital Twin (Bi-GBDT), that allows for assessment of the structural condition based on post-earthquake photographic surveys. The procedure contains two parts: (i) A GBDT of a target structure, containing a computer graphics model and a finite element (FE) model, is developed (ii) Synthetic data subsequently is generated from the GBDT to train neural networks to predict the damage measures and structural conditions. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a seismically-designed reinforced concrete shear wall is considered. First, the GBDT of the shear wall is constructed and calibrated so that the associated damage patterns simulated by the corresponding FE model match well with the experimental results. Next, synthetic images of the damage patterns are created from the validated GBDT, along with the corresponding structural damage measures, and used to train Residual Neural Network and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to determine the maximum drift, the stress/strain fields and the structural condition. The neural networks trained on synthetic data are shown to perform well for the experimental data, confirming the proposed approach. Subsequently, the neural networks are tested on the synthetic data for a wide variety of loading conditions to demonstrate the robustness of the approach. In addition, the realistic images rendered from the GBDT are utilized as input to predict the structural condition, showcasing the comprehensive Bi-GBDT framework. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to generate accurate digital twins and point toward its future application for development of automated post-earthquake assessment strategies.', 'authors': ['Guanghao Zhai', 'Yongjia Xu', 'Billie F.

It badly affects a person‚Äôs normal life. However, if we are able to detect it early and treat it, most patients will be able to recover to some degree and lead a normal life with some dependence. Continuous clinical assessment is needed for diagnosing this type of disorder. Medical diagnosis today extensively relies on deep learning approaches. However, medical image data analysis has a lot of constraints. One of the major constraints faced during medical image analysis is data scarcity and data imbalance. In light of these concerns, the current study sets out to create a hybrid deep learning model that can effectively categorise various Alzheimer's disease variants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. \\nFor solving data imbalance, first, we blur and sharpen all the images, and finally, we pass all these images along with the original images through a predefined CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model that was trained using mnist weight for extracting features, then pass these features to an extra-tree classifier for feature reduction, and finally input these reduced features to a customised deep learning model. This work used different pre-trained models for extracting features for our customised DNN (Deep Neural Network) and compared those models with the cutting-edge model chosen as the base model. The results state that our proposed model, which was pre-trained using ResNet with a dropout concept, got the highest values of training accuracy (98.20) and validation accuracy (92.61).

GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.', 'authors': ['Zesheng Sun', 'Pengcheng Huang', 'Jialiang Lin', 'Guiping Jiang', 'Jian Chen', 'Qianqian Liu'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Frontiers in Oncology', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf', 'external_ids': {'PubMedCentral': '11906671', 'DOI': '10.3389/fonc.2025.1531465', 'CorpusId': 276715703, 'PubMed': '40094001'}, 'doi': '10.3389/fonc.2025.1531465', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616540', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEWAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEWAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02d8e7-0000-0200-0000-689e78fb0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216123}, {'id': 'cdb6620e1e919a4d1309b64c7a06f2bf8da9a6006e61b8ea2b27500b0084ceec', 'paper_id': '0002dafbba9b1dfd434dcb00d6f7c8468ccdd89e', 'title': 'Diabetic Detection from Images of the Eye', 'abstract': 'This cross-sectional study aims to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients who have had retinal scans and ophthalmological exams. The research makes use of tailored retinal images together with the OPF (Optimum-Path Forest) and RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) models to categorize images according to the presence or absence of DR. In this work, features were extracted from the retinal images using both the RBM and OPF models. In particular, after a thorough system training phase, RBM was able to extract between 500 and 1000 features from the images. The study included fifteen distinct trial series, each with thirty cycles of repetition. The research comprised 122 eyes, or 73 diabetic patients, with a gender distribution that was reasonably balanced and an average age of 59.7 years. Remarkably, the RBM-1000 model stood out as the top performer, with the highest overall accuracy of 89.47% in diagnosis. In terms of specificity, the RBM-1000 and OPF-1000 models surpassed the competition, correctly categorizing all images free of DR symptoms. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning, particularly the RBM model, for self-identifying illnesses. The potential of machine learning models‚Äîin particular, RBM and OPF‚Äîto automate the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is demonstrated by this work.

To increase practitioners' and patients' trust in AI applications, AI systems need to explain their actions. This is called Explainable AI (XAI). While significant progress has been achieved in stress prediction models, XAI has not advanced as much. To overcome this gap, this work presents an explainable AI-based Multi-Layer Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (XAI_MLPCNN) architecture for stress detection. Multi-channel EEG recordings can be deconstructed into distinct frequency bands and their non-linearity and non-stationarity removed using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). When processing features, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) is employed. Conversely, the decomposed signals are employed in the automatic feature extraction process through MLPCNN, and the dual BiLSTM with self-attention layer (DBiL_SA) is utilized to predict stress. MLPCNN-DBiL_SA and PSD features are combined to improve prediction. To provide explanations or assess how explainable the predictions are, explainable artificial intelligence techniques like Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed. The Python platform is used to implement the model. Performance is further assessed using a several performance metrics, such as accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-measure. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared to other methods that are currently in use, like CNN-DWD and PSD, LSTM-DWD and PSD, BI-LSTM-DWD and PSD, RNN-DWD and PSD, and GRU-DWT AND PSD.\", 'authors': ['Fateh Bahadur Kunwar', 'Rakesh Kumar Yadav', 'Hitendra Singh', 'Nitin Tripathi'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Computer Science', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004bbb8722a20d093b5537997132dbd0cacd0ae', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.3844/jcssp.2025.1156.1167', 'CorpusId': 278637458}, 'doi': '10.3844/jcssp.2025.1156.1167', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616577', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEbAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEbAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02fbe7-0000-0200-0000-689e78fb0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216123}, {'id': '395827d2f937ac59eca2b69bb55be1b02731da703e95a8aeed2008e01efe94a1', 'paper_id': '00051115b3f59d848e44fcd1b69f18019f49a5ea', 'title': 'A multimodal machine learning fused global 0.1¬∞ daily evapotranspiration dataset from 1950-2022', 'abstract': None, 'authors': ['Qingchen Xu', 'Lu Li', 'Zhongwang Wei', 'Xingjie Lu', 'Nan Wei', 'Xuhui Lee', 'Yongjiu Dai'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Agricultural and Forest Meteorology', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00051115b3f59d848e44fcd1b69f18019f49a5ea', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110645', 'CorpusId': 279066628}, 'doi': '10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110645', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616585', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEcAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEcAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0200e8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fb0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216123}, {'id': '133c6799bde44fd416d1ce5300ac6b8b74ff360bcdc2ee5cadee3e8c660cacb0', 'paper_id': '000599cbc4db4fb6b780ddf4dfd85ef3a9430b59', 'title': 'Data-Driven Digital Twins for Real-Time Machine Monitoring: A Case Study on a Rotating Machine', 'abstract': '\\n In this work, we present a framework for data-driven digital twins for real-time machine monitoring. Data-driven digital twins are gaining prominence in a variety of industrial applications owing to their ability to capture complex relationships between sensor data and system behavior. The computational efficiency gained by using such twins is critical for real-time machine monitoring and diagnostics with timely and interactive human intervention. One of the fundamental challenges in the current data-driven digital twins is a lack of understanding of how different data synthesis strategies of the same sensor data affect the predictive power of the twin models typically obtained through statistical learning. As a result, the interactive support for enabling human intervention and machine health monitoring is not generalized for different machine configurations and fault conditions. Using turbo-machinery as a concrete demonstrative context, we investigate two fundamentally different data synthesis strategies, namely, integrated and combinatorial, as digital twins for a rotating machine. Specifically, we consider a rotor kit as a machine component, develop a synthetic dataset using simulations, and conduct systematic studies on the predictive performance of reduced order models trained using the different data data synthesis strategies. Our experiments show that the combinatorial dataset offers higher prediction accuracy in comaprison to randomized data generation. To demonstrate a practical application of our methodology, we develop a cloud-based Augmented Reality (AR) mobile tool that extracts functional information in real-time using raw data and maps to respective parts of the machine.', 'authors': ['Suryapavan Cheruku', 'Suryanarayan Balaji', 'Adolfo Delgado', 'V.

Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.\", 'authors': ['Hele Zhu', 'Xinyi Huang', 'Haojia Gao', 'Mengfei Jiang', 'Haohua Que', 'Lei Mu'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'International Conference on Intelligent Computing', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009bd5f9fec03e6308867db9ffcbbbdcbb3c0cc', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'conf/icic/ZhuHGJQM25', 'ArXiv': '2505.02877', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2505.02877', 'CorpusId': 278338910}, 'doi': '10.48550/arXiv.2505.02877', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616617', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEhAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEhAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f022de8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '085400c6e2d9f6c9b23264c785ca41ca0be20f8aff77fa150d654d848657f7d1', 'paper_id': '0009f796c3484138a58af704e07b7930d2481218', 'title': 'AI Assisted Heart Disease Prediction and Classification and Segmentation based on PIMA and UCI Machine Learning Datasets', 'abstract': \"The article is devoted to the development of an artificial intelligence-driven system of heart disease diagnosis.

This study aimed to develop and validate an ML-based model for predicting PIH and identifying key clinical predictors. A retrospective cohort study of 20,309 adult patients undergoing non-obstetric surgery under general anesthesia with intravenous induction was conducted. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PIH, defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP)\\u2009<\\u200955\\xa0mmHg within 10\\xa0min post-induction. Data were split into training and validation sets using k-fold cross-validation. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. PIH occurred in 4,948 patients (24.4%). Key predictors included preinduction systolic and mean arterial pressures, propofol dose, and beta-blocker use. The ML model achieved an AUC of 0.732 in predicting PIH. The ML-based model demonstrated significant predictive capability for PIH, identifying key clinical predictors.

Hindsight experience replay (HER) is introduced to enable DRL agents to learn from failure experiences. However, the HER-enabled model-free DRL still suffers from limited training performance due to its uniform sampling strategy and scarcity of reward information in the task environment. Inspired by the progress incentive mechanism in human psychology, we propose Progress Intrinsic Motivation-based HER (P-HER) in this work to overcome these difficulties. First, the Trajectory Progress-based Prioritized Experience Replay (TPPER) module is developed to prioritize sampling valuable trajectory data thereby achieving more efficient training. Second, the Progress Intrinsic Reward (PIR) module is introduced in agent training to add extra intrinsic rewards for encouraging the agents throughout the exploration of task space. Experiments in challenging robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our P-HER method outperforms original HER and state-of-the-art HER-based methods in training performance. Our code of P-HER and its experimental videos in both virtual and real environments are available at https://github.com/weixiang-smart/P-HER. Note to Practitioners‚ÄîThis work is motivated to develop a fast and effective learning method for intelligent robotic manipulation of typical industrial tasks, including pushing, picking, and placing workpieces, which are essential and fundamental processing plan activities for accomplishing robotic machining and assembly applications towards smart manufacturing. The introduction of reinforcement learning enables robots to learn manipulation tasks autonomously, which can save the effort for engineers to teach or hard program the robot and also reduce labor costs. However, the existing HER-based reinforcement learning algorithms are with low training efficiency and performance due to the uniform sampling and scant task reward. Inspired by human learning, this work introduces a progress incentive mechanism to identify valuable trajectory data for effective training. In addition, a novel rewarding method, that applies additional intrinsic rewards for agents learning valuable trajectory space, results in fast and robust learning. The setting of important weight parameters in the rewarding method is given in the paper, which provides a practical reference for applying the proposed algorithm. The average success rate of two actual manipulation tasks in simulation and real robotic manipulation environments are 96% and 92.5%, respectively, which demonstrates that the method is effective for both environments and there is 3.5% average gap of successful rate dropping from simulation scenarios to real ones due to the inherent mismatches between simulation and reality. The high success rate demonstrated in the real Workpieces-sorting task exemplifies the potential of the trained policies for application in industrial scenarios.', 'authors': ['Weixiang Liang', 'Yinlong Liu', 'Jikun Wang', 'Zhi-xin Yang'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c3004d2191fd115d1190cca963486e71b9e00', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'journals/tase/LiangLWY25', 'DOI': '10.1109/TASE.2024.3513354', 'CorpusId': 274693071}, 'doi': '10.1109/TASE.2024.3513354', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616649', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEmAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEmAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f025be8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '1b442954ed1adce59e50ac31043a820ec6b907ed572ed219233c02f894dcbc96', 'paper_id': '000d5261e4bc230a8c8aacdd3aab5e878a8da174', 'title': 'Enhancing 5G-VANET Environments with SDN-Based Package Filtering for Improved Networking', 'abstract': \"‚Äì This research explores the integration of Software-Defined Networking into 5G-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (5G-VANETs) with a focus on the implementation of a package filtering model. The goal is to enhance networking within these dynamic environments. By leveraging SDN's centralized control capabilities, this study aims to optimize network performance, enhance security, and improve the quality of service in 5G-VANETs. The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks. As the VANET milieu operates dynamically, the major issues are to afford high reliability, low latency, and high bandwidth. 5G significantly provides seamless connectivity and ultrafast speed for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To avoid these issues, this work implements the Package Filtering Model (PFM) that is trained using machine learning and ready to use for real-time detection. It filters out the fraudulent transaction based on the frequency and behavioural characteristics of the communication. The simulation results ensure that the proposed mechanism affords enhanced packet delivery, lower transmission delay, minimum fraud package, and bare minimum block processing time compared to the existing state-of-the-art mechanisms.\", 'authors': ['P.

Today, modern cyberattacks are too unpredictable for the old cybersecurity defenses and time-bound detection methods. Because there are more complex, numerous and distant threats today, to find them and address them before much damage can occur. In this work, look at integrating AI and OSINT to develop a system that can quickly detect any cyber threats in an organization. The researchers used the Hornet 40 dataset which includes network traffic collected over the course of 40 days from honeypots in eight places: Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, San Francisco, New York, Singapore, Toronto, and Bangalore. To capture different activities from uninvited users, these honeypots received requests only on a specific non-standard SSH port. The information provided by Argus is in the form of detailed bidirectional NetFlow data that displays the effects of geography on various cyber-attacks. Various machine learning approaches are used within a data-driven system to spot and detect abnormal traffic and threats in the network such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Isolation Forests. At the same time, data, and findings from public threat intelligence, darknet sources and cybersecurity forums are studied using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to find important information about threats. As a result of this, the detection rate is improved by comparing suspicious traffic in honeypots with global findings and the reported IOCs. Combining AI and OSINT together allows the engine to read and analyze a lot of network data quickly and in almost real time. Joining these processes allows quick and early identification of advanced attacks such as zero-day attacks and intrusions. It is clear from the results that using this approach improves the accuracy of detection, lowers the number of false positives, and reveals attacks that tend to come from specific locations and are typically overlooked by other systems.', 'authors': ['Jafrin Reza', 'Md Imran Khan', 'Sanjida Akrer Sarna'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f3ab2c2524fdb01a1591a23d4ea94539a6280', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.32996/jcsts.2025.7.5.62', 'CorpusId': 279175728}, 'doi': '10.32996/jcsts.2025.7.5.62', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616673', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEqAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEqAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0272e8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '34c32e4a2d01992d33e6502ac2c50a4f47198535cab7d4ffe1b8a57a5e566368', 'paper_id': '0010055f516a1669a42efccfbe112d721357e104', 'title': 'Deep learning meets tree phenology modelling: PhenoFormer versus process‚Äêbased models', 'abstract': 'Predicting phenology, that is the timing of seasonal events of plant life such as leaf emergence and colouration in relation to climate fluctuations, is essential for anticipating future changes in carbon sequestration and tree vitality in temperate forest ecosystems. Existing approaches typically rely on either hypothesis‚Äêdriven process models or data‚Äêdriven statistical methods. Several studies have shown that process models outperform statistical methods when predicting under climatic conditions that differ from those of the training data, such as for climate change scenarios. However, in terms of statistical methods, deep learning approaches remain underexplored for species‚Äêlevel phenology modelling. We present a deep neural architecture, PhenoFormer, for species‚Äêlevel phenology prediction using meteorological time series. Our experiments utilise a country‚Äêscale data set comprising 70\\u2009years of climate data and approximately 70,000 phenological observations of nine woody plant species, focussing on leaf emergence and colouration in Switzerland. We extensively compare PhenoFormer to 18 different process‚Äêbased models and traditional machine learning methods, including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM). Our results demonstrate that PhenoFormer outperforms traditional statistical methods in phenology prediction while achieving significant improvements or comparable performance to the best process‚Äêbased models. When predicting under climatic conditions similar to the training data, our model improved over the best process‚Äêbased models by 6% normalised root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquared error (nRMSE) for spring phenology and 7% nRMSE for autumn phenology. Under conditions involving substantial climatic shifts between training and testing (+1.21¬∞C), PhenoFormer reduced the nRMSE by an average of 8% across species compared to RF and GBM, and performed on par with the best process models. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for phenology modelling and call for further research in this direction, particularly for future climate projections. Meanwhile, the advancements achieved by PhenoFormer can provide valuable insights for anticipating species‚Äêspecific phenological responses to climate change.', 'authors': ['Vivien Sainte Fare Garnot', 'Lynsay Spafford', 'J.
