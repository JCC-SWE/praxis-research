The purpose of the study is a comprehensive assessment of the potential benefits and risks of introducing AI into education in terms of their impact on sustainable development. Tasks include: identification of key AI application opportunities to improve the quality, accessibility, and inclusivity of education (SDG 4); analysis of issues related to ethics, algorithm bias, digital inequality, and the need for retraining; assessment of the impact of AI on the formation of competencies necessary for a sustainable future. The results show the significant potential of AI in personalizing learning, automating routine tasks, and providing access to knowledge, but also reveal serious risks of exacerbating social inequality (SDG 10) and ethical dilemmas. The scientific novelty lies in the systematic consideration of the relationship between the introduction of AI in education and the achievement of the SDGs, offering a balanced view of the challenges and opportunities. The practical significance lies in the formulation of recommendations for policy makers, educators, and developers on responsible and sustainability-oriented implementation of AI in educational systems.', 'authors': ['S.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians‚Äô expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE‚Äôs performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors. Our research has several limitations and should be interpreted with caution. Clinicians used synchronous text chat, which permits large-scale LLM‚Äìpatient interactions, but this is unfamiliar in clinical practice. While further research is required before AMIE could be translated to real-world settings, the results represent a milestone towards conversational diagnostic AI.', 'authors': ['Tao Tu', 'M.

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems capable of diagnostic dialogue could increase accessibility and quality of care. However, approximating clinicians‚Äô expertise is an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce AMIE (Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer), a large language model (LLM)-based AI system optimized for diagnostic dialogue. AMIE uses a self-play-based3 simulated environment with automated feedback for scaling learning across disease conditions, specialties and contexts. We designed a framework for evaluating clinically meaningful axes of performance, including history-taking, diagnostic accuracy, management, communication skills and empathy. We compared AMIE‚Äôs performance to that of primary care physicians in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of text-based consultations with validated patient-actors similar to objective structured clinical examination4,5. The study included 159 case scenarios from providers in Canada, the United Kingdom and India, 20 primary care physicians compared to AMIE, and evaluations by specialist physicians and patient-actors. AMIE demonstrated greater diagnostic accuracy and superior performance on 30 out of 32 axes according to the specialist physicians and 25 out of 26 axes according to the patient-actors.

Reporting guidelines need to be updated to take into account this advance. The SCARE Guideline 2025 update adds a new AI-focused domain to promote transparency, reproducibility, and ethical integrity in surgical case reports involving AI.\\n\\nMethods: A Delphi consensus exercise was conducted to update the SCARE guidelines. A panel of 49 surgical and scientific experts were invited to rate proposed new items. In round 1, participants scored each item on a 9-point Likert scale and provided feedback. Items not meeting consensus were revised or discarded.\\n\\nResults: A 94% response rate occurred amongst participants (46/49) in the first round. Ratings were analysed for agreement levels, and consensus was reached on all six proposed AI-related items. A revised SCARE checklist is presented which incorporates these new AI related items. Authors are now expected to disclose AI involvement not only in patient care but also in manuscript preparation, as exemplified by this paper.\\n\\nConclusion: The SCARE 2025 guideline provides an up-to-date framework for surgical case reports in the era of AI. Through a robust consensus process, we have added specific reporting criteria for AI to ensure that any use of artificial intelligence in a case report is clearly documented, explained and discussed including with respect to bias and ethics. This update will help maintain the quality, transparency, and clinical relevance of case reports, ultimately improving their educational value and trustworthiness for the surgical community.', 'authors': ['Ahmed Kerwan', 'A.

Nonetheless, the inherent visual similarities between benign and malignant lesions pose substantial challenges to accurate classification. To overcome these obstacles, this study proposes an innovative hybrid deep learning model that combines ConvNeXtV2 blocks and separable self-attention mechanisms, tailored to enhance feature extraction and optimize classification performance. The inclusion of ConvNeXtV2 blocks in the initial two stages is driven by their ability to effectively capture fine-grained local features and subtle patterns, which are critical for distinguishing between visually similar lesion types. Meanwhile, the adoption of separable self-attention in the later stages allows the model to selectively prioritize diagnostically relevant regions while minimizing computational complexity, addressing the inefficiencies often associated with traditional self-attention mechanisms. The model was comprehensively trained and validated on the ISIC 2019 dataset, which includes eight distinct skin lesion categories. Advanced methodologies such as data augmentation and transfer learning were employed to further enhance model robustness and reliability. The proposed architecture achieved exceptional performance metrics, with 93.48% accuracy, 93.24% precision, 90.70% recall, and a 91.82% F1-score, outperforming over ten Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based and over ten Vision Transformer (ViT) based models tested under comparable conditions.

As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they were last year.\", 'authors': ['Nick Craswell', 'Bhaskar Mitra', 'Emine Yilmaz', 'Daniel Fernando Campos', 'Jimmy Lin', 'E.

Traditional rule-based systems are increasingly inadequate in identifying fraudulent patterns, especially with the advent of more complex and subtle fraud strategies. This study explores state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of credit card fraud detection systems. Various algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are evaluated using a publicly available credit card transaction dataset. Emphasis is placed on the importance of handling class imbalance, which is a critical issue in fraud detection, by employing techniques like SMOTE and cost-sensitive learning. Feature engineering and data preprocessing play vital roles in improving model performance, and these are rigorously addressed in the methodology. Performance is assessed using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to ensure balanced evaluation. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly LSTM and CNNs, outperform traditional machine learning techniques in capturing temporal and spatial transaction patterns. However, the choice of algorithm may vary depending on the computational resources and the real-time nature of deployment. The proposed system integrates the most effective models into a hybrid framework that balances accuracy and efficiency.

However, few studies have attempted to establish the complex relationship between visible damage and structural conditions. Moreover, the lack of training data further hinders the potential use of deep learning algorithms. This paper proposes a framework, termed Bidirectional Graphics-based Digital Twin (Bi-GBDT), that allows for assessment of the structural condition based on post-earthquake photographic surveys. The procedure contains two parts: (i) A GBDT of a target structure, containing a computer graphics model and a finite element (FE) model, is developed (ii) Synthetic data subsequently is generated from the GBDT to train neural networks to predict the damage measures and structural conditions. To demonstrate the proposed approach, a seismically-designed reinforced concrete shear wall is considered. First, the GBDT of the shear wall is constructed and calibrated so that the associated damage patterns simulated by the corresponding FE model match well with the experimental results. Next, synthetic images of the damage patterns are created from the validated GBDT, along with the corresponding structural damage measures, and used to train Residual Neural Network and Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks to determine the maximum drift, the stress/strain fields and the structural condition. The neural networks trained on synthetic data are shown to perform well for the experimental data, confirming the proposed approach. Subsequently, the neural networks are tested on the synthetic data for a wide variety of loading conditions to demonstrate the robustness of the approach. In addition, the realistic images rendered from the GBDT are utilized as input to predict the structural condition, showcasing the comprehensive Bi-GBDT framework. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach to generate accurate digital twins and point toward its future application for development of automated post-earthquake assessment strategies.', 'authors': ['Guanghao Zhai', 'Yongjia Xu', 'Billie F.

It badly affects a person‚Äôs normal life. However, if we are able to detect it early and treat it, most patients will be able to recover to some degree and lead a normal life with some dependence. Continuous clinical assessment is needed for diagnosing this type of disorder. Medical diagnosis today extensively relies on deep learning approaches. However, medical image data analysis has a lot of constraints. One of the major constraints faced during medical image analysis is data scarcity and data imbalance. In light of these concerns, the current study sets out to create a hybrid deep learning model that can effectively categorise various Alzheimer's disease variants using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. \\nFor solving data imbalance, first, we blur and sharpen all the images, and finally, we pass all these images along with the original images through a predefined CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model that was trained using mnist weight for extracting features, then pass these features to an extra-tree classifier for feature reduction, and finally input these reduced features to a customised deep learning model. This work used different pre-trained models for extracting features for our customised DNN (Deep Neural Network) and compared those models with the cutting-edge model chosen as the base model. The results state that our proposed model, which was pre-trained using ResNet with a dropout concept, got the highest values of training accuracy (98.20) and validation accuracy (92.61).

GBM is characterized by high recurrence rates and treatment resistance, leading to poor patient outcomes. Current prognostic models have limited predictive power, underscoring the need to elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify novel biomarkers to improve therapeutic strategies and prognostic models. Methods Gene expression and clinical data for GBM and LGG were obtained from the TCGA and CGGA database, while single-cell sequencing data from GSE167960 were selected from the GEO database. Molecular characteristics of gliomas were revealed through normalization, consensus clustering analysis, immune scoring, cell infiltration analysis, and pathway analysis. TUBA1B, identified as a key gene through machine learning, was incorporated into a nomogram model using multivariate Cox regression. Its functions were validated through qRT-PCR, in vitro functional assays, and mouse xenograft models. All data analyses and statistics were performed using R software. Results Consensus clustering of the TCGA glioma dataset identified two aggrephagy subtypes (C1 and C2), with C2 showing worse survival outcomes and higher immune infiltration. TUBA1B was identified as an independent prognostic marker, with high expression associated with upregulated cell cycle pathways and alterations in the immune microenvironment. TUBA1B was shown to influence glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and autophagy, impacting tumor progression and treatment response through intercellular communication and metabolic pathways. Conclusion The study demonstrates that high TUBA1B expression is closely associated with glioma malignancy and poor prognosis, making it a potential therapeutic target.', 'authors': ['Zesheng Sun', 'Pengcheng Huang', 'Jialiang Lin', 'Guiping Jiang', 'Jian Chen', 'Qianqian Liu'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Frontiers in Oncology', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0001d0ebfeb82a9c0fe964bd5ca0811f352883cf', 'external_ids': {'PubMedCentral': '11906671', 'DOI': '10.3389/fonc.2025.1531465', 'CorpusId': 276715703, 'PubMed': '40094001'}, 'doi': '10.3389/fonc.2025.1531465', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616540', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEWAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEWAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02d8e7-0000-0200-0000-689e78fb0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216123}, {'id': 'cdb6620e1e919a4d1309b64c7a06f2bf8da9a6006e61b8ea2b27500b0084ceec', 'paper_id': '0002dafbba9b1dfd434dcb00d6f7c8468ccdd89e', 'title': 'Diabetic Detection from Images of the Eye', 'abstract': 'This cross-sectional study aims to detect Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in patients who have had retinal scans and ophthalmological exams. The research makes use of tailored retinal images together with the OPF (Optimum-Path Forest) and RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine) models to categorize images according to the presence or absence of DR. In this work, features were extracted from the retinal images using both the RBM and OPF models. In particular, after a thorough system training phase, RBM was able to extract between 500 and 1000 features from the images. The study included fifteen distinct trial series, each with thirty cycles of repetition. The research comprised 122 eyes, or 73 diabetic patients, with a gender distribution that was reasonably balanced and an average age of 59.7 years. Remarkably, the RBM-1000 model stood out as the top performer, with the highest overall accuracy of 89.47% in diagnosis. In terms of specificity, the RBM-1000 and OPF-1000 models surpassed the competition, correctly categorizing all images free of DR symptoms. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning, particularly the RBM model, for self-identifying illnesses. The potential of machine learning models‚Äîin particular, RBM and OPF‚Äîto automate the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is demonstrated by this work.

To increase practitioners' and patients' trust in AI applications, AI systems need to explain their actions. This is called Explainable AI (XAI). While significant progress has been achieved in stress prediction models, XAI has not advanced as much. To overcome this gap, this work presents an explainable AI-based Multi-Layer Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (XAI_MLPCNN) architecture for stress detection. Multi-channel EEG recordings can be deconstructed into distinct frequency bands and their non-linearity and non-stationarity removed using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). When processing features, the Power Spectral Density (PSD) is employed. Conversely, the decomposed signals are employed in the automatic feature extraction process through MLPCNN, and the dual BiLSTM with self-attention layer (DBiL_SA) is utilized to predict stress. MLPCNN-DBiL_SA and PSD features are combined to improve prediction. To provide explanations or assess how explainable the predictions are, explainable artificial intelligence techniques like Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) are employed. The Python platform is used to implement the model. Performance is further assessed using a several performance metrics, such as accuracy, recall, precision, and f1-measure. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared to other methods that are currently in use, like CNN-DWD and PSD, LSTM-DWD and PSD, BI-LSTM-DWD and PSD, RNN-DWD and PSD, and GRU-DWT AND PSD.\", 'authors': ['Fateh Bahadur Kunwar', 'Rakesh Kumar Yadav', 'Hitendra Singh', 'Nitin Tripathi'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Computer Science', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0004bbb8722a20d093b5537997132dbd0cacd0ae', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.3844/jcssp.2025.1156.1167', 'CorpusId': 278637458}, 'doi': '10.3844/jcssp.2025.1156.1167', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616577', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEbAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEbAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02fbe7-0000-0200-0000-689e78fb0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216123}, {'id': '395827d2f937ac59eca2b69bb55be1b02731da703e95a8aeed2008e01efe94a1', 'paper_id': '00051115b3f59d848e44fcd1b69f18019f49a5ea', 'title': 'A multimodal machine learning fused global 0.1¬∞ daily evapotranspiration dataset from 1950-2022', 'abstract': None, 'authors': ['Qingchen Xu', 'Lu Li', 'Zhongwang Wei', 'Xingjie Lu', 'Nan Wei', 'Xuhui Lee', 'Yongjiu Dai'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Agricultural and Forest Meteorology', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00051115b3f59d848e44fcd1b69f18019f49a5ea', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110645', 'CorpusId': 279066628}, 'doi': '10.1016/j.agrformet.2025.110645', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616585', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEcAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEcAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0200e8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fb0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216123}, {'id': '133c6799bde44fd416d1ce5300ac6b8b74ff360bcdc2ee5cadee3e8c660cacb0', 'paper_id': '000599cbc4db4fb6b780ddf4dfd85ef3a9430b59', 'title': 'Data-Driven Digital Twins for Real-Time Machine Monitoring: A Case Study on a Rotating Machine', 'abstract': '\\n In this work, we present a framework for data-driven digital twins for real-time machine monitoring. Data-driven digital twins are gaining prominence in a variety of industrial applications owing to their ability to capture complex relationships between sensor data and system behavior. The computational efficiency gained by using such twins is critical for real-time machine monitoring and diagnostics with timely and interactive human intervention. One of the fundamental challenges in the current data-driven digital twins is a lack of understanding of how different data synthesis strategies of the same sensor data affect the predictive power of the twin models typically obtained through statistical learning. As a result, the interactive support for enabling human intervention and machine health monitoring is not generalized for different machine configurations and fault conditions. Using turbo-machinery as a concrete demonstrative context, we investigate two fundamentally different data synthesis strategies, namely, integrated and combinatorial, as digital twins for a rotating machine. Specifically, we consider a rotor kit as a machine component, develop a synthetic dataset using simulations, and conduct systematic studies on the predictive performance of reduced order models trained using the different data data synthesis strategies. Our experiments show that the combinatorial dataset offers higher prediction accuracy in comaprison to randomized data generation. To demonstrate a practical application of our methodology, we develop a cloud-based Augmented Reality (AR) mobile tool that extracts functional information in real-time using raw data and maps to respective parts of the machine.', 'authors': ['Suryapavan Cheruku', 'Suryanarayan Balaji', 'Adolfo Delgado', 'V.

Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.\", 'authors': ['Hele Zhu', 'Xinyi Huang', 'Haojia Gao', 'Mengfei Jiang', 'Haohua Que', 'Lei Mu'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'International Conference on Intelligent Computing', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0009bd5f9fec03e6308867db9ffcbbbdcbb3c0cc', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'conf/icic/ZhuHGJQM25', 'ArXiv': '2505.02877', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2505.02877', 'CorpusId': 278338910}, 'doi': '10.48550/arXiv.2505.02877', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616617', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEhAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEhAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f022de8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '085400c6e2d9f6c9b23264c785ca41ca0be20f8aff77fa150d654d848657f7d1', 'paper_id': '0009f796c3484138a58af704e07b7930d2481218', 'title': 'AI Assisted Heart Disease Prediction and Classification and Segmentation based on PIMA and UCI Machine Learning Datasets', 'abstract': \"The article is devoted to the development of an artificial intelligence-driven system of heart disease diagnosis.

This study aimed to develop and validate an ML-based model for predicting PIH and identifying key clinical predictors. A retrospective cohort study of 20,309 adult patients undergoing non-obstetric surgery under general anesthesia with intravenous induction was conducted. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PIH, defined as mean arterial pressure (MAP)\\u2009<\\u200955\\xa0mmHg within 10\\xa0min post-induction. Data were split into training and validation sets using k-fold cross-validation. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and feature importance was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values. PIH occurred in 4,948 patients (24.4%). Key predictors included preinduction systolic and mean arterial pressures, propofol dose, and beta-blocker use. The ML model achieved an AUC of 0.732 in predicting PIH. The ML-based model demonstrated significant predictive capability for PIH, identifying key clinical predictors.

Hindsight experience replay (HER) is introduced to enable DRL agents to learn from failure experiences. However, the HER-enabled model-free DRL still suffers from limited training performance due to its uniform sampling strategy and scarcity of reward information in the task environment. Inspired by the progress incentive mechanism in human psychology, we propose Progress Intrinsic Motivation-based HER (P-HER) in this work to overcome these difficulties. First, the Trajectory Progress-based Prioritized Experience Replay (TPPER) module is developed to prioritize sampling valuable trajectory data thereby achieving more efficient training. Second, the Progress Intrinsic Reward (PIR) module is introduced in agent training to add extra intrinsic rewards for encouraging the agents throughout the exploration of task space. Experiments in challenging robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that our P-HER method outperforms original HER and state-of-the-art HER-based methods in training performance. Our code of P-HER and its experimental videos in both virtual and real environments are available at https://github.com/weixiang-smart/P-HER. Note to Practitioners‚ÄîThis work is motivated to develop a fast and effective learning method for intelligent robotic manipulation of typical industrial tasks, including pushing, picking, and placing workpieces, which are essential and fundamental processing plan activities for accomplishing robotic machining and assembly applications towards smart manufacturing. The introduction of reinforcement learning enables robots to learn manipulation tasks autonomously, which can save the effort for engineers to teach or hard program the robot and also reduce labor costs. However, the existing HER-based reinforcement learning algorithms are with low training efficiency and performance due to the uniform sampling and scant task reward. Inspired by human learning, this work introduces a progress incentive mechanism to identify valuable trajectory data for effective training. In addition, a novel rewarding method, that applies additional intrinsic rewards for agents learning valuable trajectory space, results in fast and robust learning. The setting of important weight parameters in the rewarding method is given in the paper, which provides a practical reference for applying the proposed algorithm. The average success rate of two actual manipulation tasks in simulation and real robotic manipulation environments are 96% and 92.5%, respectively, which demonstrates that the method is effective for both environments and there is 3.5% average gap of successful rate dropping from simulation scenarios to real ones due to the inherent mismatches between simulation and reality. The high success rate demonstrated in the real Workpieces-sorting task exemplifies the potential of the trained policies for application in industrial scenarios.', 'authors': ['Weixiang Liang', 'Yinlong Liu', 'Jikun Wang', 'Zhi-xin Yang'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000c3004d2191fd115d1190cca963486e71b9e00', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'journals/tase/LiangLWY25', 'DOI': '10.1109/TASE.2024.3513354', 'CorpusId': 274693071}, 'doi': '10.1109/TASE.2024.3513354', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616649', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEmAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEmAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f025be8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '1b442954ed1adce59e50ac31043a820ec6b907ed572ed219233c02f894dcbc96', 'paper_id': '000d5261e4bc230a8c8aacdd3aab5e878a8da174', 'title': 'Enhancing 5G-VANET Environments with SDN-Based Package Filtering for Improved Networking', 'abstract': \"‚Äì This research explores the integration of Software-Defined Networking into 5G-enabled Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (5G-VANETs) with a focus on the implementation of a package filtering model.

The outcomes of this research have the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of intelligent transportation systems and vehicular communication networks.

Advancements in internet of vehicle brought few security issues such as illegal device access, data injection, and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Today, modern cyberattacks are too unpredictable for the old cybersecurity defenses and time-bound detection methods. Because there are more complex, numerous and distant threats today, to find them and address them before much damage can occur. In this work, look at integrating AI and OSINT to develop a system that can quickly detect any cyber threats in an organization. The researchers used the Hornet 40 dataset which includes network traffic collected over the course of 40 days from honeypots in eight places: Amsterdam, London, Frankfurt, San Francisco, New York, Singapore, Toronto, and Bangalore. To capture different activities from uninvited users, these honeypots received requests only on a specific non-standard SSH port. The information provided by Argus is in the form of detailed bidirectional NetFlow data that displays the effects of geography on various cyber-attacks. Various machine learning approaches are used within a data-driven system to spot and detect abnormal traffic and threats in the network such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Isolation Forests. At the same time, data, and findings from public threat intelligence, darknet sources and cybersecurity forums are studied using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to find important information about threats. As a result of this, the detection rate is improved by comparing suspicious traffic in honeypots with global findings and the reported IOCs. Combining AI and OSINT together allows the engine to read and analyze a lot of network data quickly and in almost real time. Joining these processes allows quick and early identification of advanced attacks such as zero-day attacks and intrusions. It is clear from the results that using this approach improves the accuracy of detection, lowers the number of false positives, and reveals attacks that tend to come from specific locations and are typically overlooked by other systems.', 'authors': ['Jafrin Reza', 'Md Imran Khan', 'Sanjida Akrer Sarna'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000f3ab2c2524fdb01a1591a23d4ea94539a6280', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.32996/jcsts.2025.7.5.62', 'CorpusId': 279175728}, 'doi': '10.32996/jcsts.2025.7.5.62', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616673', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEqAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEqAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0272e8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '34c32e4a2d01992d33e6502ac2c50a4f47198535cab7d4ffe1b8a57a5e566368', 'paper_id': '0010055f516a1669a42efccfbe112d721357e104', 'title': 'Deep learning meets tree phenology modelling: PhenoFormer versus process‚Äêbased models', 'abstract': 'Predicting phenology, that is the timing of seasonal events of plant life such as leaf emergence and colouration in relation to climate fluctuations, is essential for anticipating future changes in carbon sequestration and tree vitality in temperate forest ecosystems. Existing approaches typically rely on either hypothesis‚Äêdriven process models or data‚Äêdriven statistical methods. Several studies have shown that process models outperform statistical methods when predicting under climatic conditions that differ from those of the training data, such as for climate change scenarios. However, in terms of statistical methods, deep learning approaches remain underexplored for species‚Äêlevel phenology modelling. We present a deep neural architecture, PhenoFormer, for species‚Äêlevel phenology prediction using meteorological time series. Our experiments utilise a country‚Äêscale data set comprising 70\\u2009years of climate data and approximately 70,000 phenological observations of nine woody plant species, focussing on leaf emergence and colouration in Switzerland. We extensively compare PhenoFormer to 18 different process‚Äêbased models and traditional machine learning methods, including Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM). Our results demonstrate that PhenoFormer outperforms traditional statistical methods in phenology prediction while achieving significant improvements or comparable performance to the best process‚Äêbased models. When predicting under climatic conditions similar to the training data, our model improved over the best process‚Äêbased models by 6% normalised root‚Äêmean‚Äêsquared error (nRMSE) for spring phenology and 7% nRMSE for autumn phenology. Under conditions involving substantial climatic shifts between training and testing (+1.21¬∞C), PhenoFormer reduced the nRMSE by an average of 8% across species compared to RF and GBM, and performed on par with the best process models. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning for phenology modelling and call for further research in this direction, particularly for future climate projections.

With powerful analysis tools, we attempted to detect trends in exporting and importing, estimate the contribution of such technology to the economy, and estimate the effectiveness of supporting policies. The scope of our activity was U.S. low-carbon technology trade, both its imports and its exports. Examining a rich dataset including volumes of trade, technological categories, and economic factors, we try to unveil deeper trends driving this new sector. The dataset for analysis in such a case involved in-depth information drawn from a range of reliable sources, including U.S. trade reports, economic statistics, and global databases for sustainability. Trade volumes, in terms of value and quantity of low-carbon technology exported and imported, form one of the key variables in such a dataset. There was extensive information about carbon emissions, providing an analysis of the impact on terms of the environment through such technology, and policy incentives, in terms of government actions for encouragement of low-carbon alternatives. In selecting machine learning models for examining low-carbon technology trade, three candidates‚ÄîLogistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)‚Äîstood out for their particular strengths. In terms of accuracy, the SVM model is the top scorer, closely followed by KNN, while Logistic Regression takes a considerable drop, indicating its relatively lower predictive capability. Precision measurements also rank similarly, with SVM and KNN recording high precision values, suggesting that they are reliable in predicting true positives. Recall scores also indicate the strength of SVM and KNN in recalling all instances, while the Logistic Regression model records lower recall, particularly in predicting the class. Finally, the F1 score, being the trade-off between precision and recall, further reinforces the superior performance of SVM and KNN, as both models record high scores, with Logistic Regression lagging. To enhance the U.S. position in the global low-carbon technology market, a multi-faceted approach must be taken. Firstly, efforts must be made to drive innovation through increased investment in research and development (R&D). For business firms and investors, the transition to a low-carbon economy presents a plethora of market opportunities in the low-carbon technology sector. U.S. firms can leverage growing consumer demand for green products by developing product lines to cater to renewable energy systems, energy-efficient appliances, and electric vehicles. For investors, an understanding of the dynamics of the low-carbon technology market is essential for risk management through predictive economic modeling. It is necessary to synchronize trade policy with U.S. and global carbon reduction objectives to foster a sustainable economy.\", 'authors': ['Md Sumon Gazi', 'Ayan Barua', 'Fazle Karim', 'Md Ismail Hossain Siddiqui', 'Niropam Das', 'Md Raisul Islam', 'MD Abdul Fahim Zeeshan', 'Md Anisur Rahman', 'Md Abdullah Al Montaser'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Ecohumanism', 'citation_count': 9, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0015d5178ae5c1b27a18eb71867126369b689f55', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.62754/joe.v4i1.6412', 'CorpusId': 276414924}, 'doi': '10.62754/joe.v4i1.6412', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616708', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPEwAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPEwAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0297e8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': '2effec5b819c7e1afa2f08450e5f4e9a79410d3891cd53af697eb87edb478007', 'paper_id': '0016318d683dc3dab0512657df6e98016f2f64e0', 'title': 'Exploring the Inequitable Impact of Data Missingness on Fairness in Machine Learning', 'abstract': 'Today, data-driven models and artificial intelligence/machine learning underlie decision making in almost all aspects of society.

This is a significant problem since data in real-world settings is almost never complete and may often suffer from systemic missingness. This article systematically evaluates how missing data, particularly when correlated with protected classes and outcome variables, affects the fairness of classifiers. Utilizing a comprehensive framework covering various missing data patterns, rates, and mitigation methods, we analyze 150 experimental dataset variants derived from real-world scenarios and find that missing data correlated with sensitive attributes and outcomes can exacerbate disparities, even for little missingness, making it crucial to address missingness in fairness evaluations.', 'authors': ['Sitao Min', 'H.

This paper leverages the geometric symmetry of a four-roll mill (FRM) to enhance its training efficiency. Stabilising and precisely controlling droplet trajectories in an FRM is challenging due to the unstable nature of the extensional flow with a saddle point. Extending the work of Vona & Lauga (Phys. Rev. E, vol. 104(5), 2021, p. 055108), this study applies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to effectively guide a displaced droplet to the centre of the FRM. Through direct numerical simulations, we explore the applicability of DRL in controlling FRM flow with moderate inertial effects, i.e. Reynolds number \\n$\\\\sim \\\\mathcal{O}(1)$\\n , a nonlinear regime previously unexplored. The FRM‚Äôs geometric symmetry allows control policies trained in one of the eight sub-quadrants to be extended to the entire domain, reducing training costs. Our results indicate that the DRL-based control method can successfully guide a displaced droplet to the target centre with robust performance across various starting positions, even from substantially far distances. The work also highlights potential directions for future research, particularly focusing on efficiently addressing the delay effects in flow response caused by inertia. This study presents new advances in controlling droplet trajectories in more nonlinear and complex situations, with potential applications to other nonlinear flows. The geometric symmetry used in this cutting-edge reinforcement learning approach can also be applied to other control methods.', 'authors': ['Xuan Dai', 'Dayou Xu', 'Mengqi Zhang', 'Yantao Yang'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Fluid Mechanics', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001693c1ed93393af3f2fb5a07c5357848d455d0', 'external_ids': {'ArXiv': '2504.20336', 'DOI': '10.1017/jfm.2025.10212', 'CorpusId': 278171207}, 'doi': '10.1017/jfm.2025.10212', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616728', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPE0AAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPE0AAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02b9e8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fc0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216124}, {'id': 'ec217d3236b51a1b55506815f2b154ce0e5bf9e5ab7e6fbc4ab8791f14b350c8', 'paper_id': '001771eef1a0fb2a0ecb2a39c39f23a7436cfdd5', 'title': 'Comparison of the Use of Support Vector Machine (SVM) & Random Forest Algorithms (RF) for DDOS Attack Detection', 'abstract': 'DDoS attack is one of the major challenges to network security in today‚Äôs time, destroying services and creating huge losses.

Due to possible devastating consequences, counteracting sensor data attacks is an extremely important topic, which has not seen sufficient study. This paper develops the first methods that accurately identify/eliminate only the problematic attacked sensor data presented to a sequence estimation/regression algorithm under a powerful attack model constructed based on known/observed attacks. The approach does not assume a known form for the statistical model of the sensor data, allowing data-driven and machine learning sequence estimation/regression algorithms to be protected. A simple protection approach for attackers not endowed with knowledge of the details of our protection approach is first developed, followed by additional processing for attacks based on protection system knowledge. In the cases tested for which it was designed, experimental results show that the simple approach achieves performance indistinguishable, to two decimal places, from that for an approach which knows which sensors are attacked. For cases where the attacker has knowledge of the protection approach, experimental results indicate the additional processing can be configured so that the worst-case degradation under the additional processing and a large number of sensors attacked can be made significantly smaller than the worst-case degradation of the simple approach, and close to an approach which knows which sensors are attacked, for the same number of attacked sensors with just a slight degradation under no attacks. Mathematical descriptions of the worst-case attacks are used to demonstrate the additional processing will provide similar advantages for cases for which we do not have numerical results.

With the increasing adoption of machine learning to solve partial differential equations, the solver for this problem is becoming ever more intelligent. However, current intelligent partial differential equation solvers for solving this problem commonly lack the ability to generalize across multiple parameters and conditions. In the context of porous media seepage, existing solvers face challenges in capturing the local effects of geological parameters on fluid flow. This limitation necessitates repeated targeted calculations under varying geological conditions, leading to high spatiotemporal costs and reducing the model's capability to draw generalizations among distinct scenarios. To overcome this barrier, a deep operator neural network based on the feature attention mechanism is proposed. The auxiliary fitting network of deep operators is used to encode information about the complex geological conditions affecting flow in porous media. Then, the feature attention mechanism is used to identify and select the crucial local features from the encoded auxiliary and spatiotemporal information. Finally, the model aggregates these features to fit the pressure and saturation fields under the spatiotemporal variations of the fundamental flow problem in porous media. The model's capacity to address two-phase porous seepage problems was substantiated under three distinct heterogeneous geological conditions. The experimental outcomes substantiate the model's superiority in terms of robustness and generalization, and the feature attention mechanism notably enhances the model's prediction accuracy.\", 'authors': ['Renyao Lin', 'Tao Song', 'Jian Li'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'The Physics of Fluids', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e414de83ac00f2f1d236e19c64f2c45b6f5ec', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.1063/5.0272866', 'CorpusId': 279849154}, 'doi': '10.1063/5.0272866', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616800', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPFAAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPFAAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02fee8-0000-0200-0000-689e78fd0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216125}, {'id': '0f24da57298bdfeb48a30dd6bdcd345ebe1c9d8782c639472f419d3d99eac21c', 'paper_id': '001e72390af58c11778f813a4e2440371180c6f4', 'title': 'Machine Learning Framework for Characterizing Processing-Structure Relationship in Block Copolymer Thin Films', 'abstract': 'The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$>0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$<0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.', 'authors': ['Bradley G.

This research introduces a system combining vehicle make and model detection with Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), achieving a groundbreaking 97.5% accuracy rate. Unlike traditional methods, which focus on either make and model detection or ANPR independently, this study integrates both aspects into a single, cohesive system, providing a more holistic and efficient solution for vehicle identification, ensuring robust performance even in adverse weather conditions. The paper explores the use of deep learning techniques, including OpenCV, in combination with Python programming language. Leveraging MobileNet-V2 and YOLOx (You Only Look Once) for vehicle identification, and YOLOv4-tiny, Paddle OCR (optical character recognition), and SVTR-tiny for ANPR, the system was rigorously tested at Firat University‚Äôs entrance with a thousand images captured under various conditions such as fog, rain, and low light. The system‚Äôs exceptional success rate in these tests highlights its robustness and practical applicability. Additionally, experiments evaluate the system‚Äôs accuracy and effectiveness, using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GradCam) technology to gain insights into neural networks‚Äô decision-making processes and identify areas for improvement, particularly in misclassifications. The implications of this research for computer vision are significant, paving the way for advanced applications in autonomous driving, traffic management, stolen vehicles, and security surveillance.

Subsequently, a DCNN is introduced to extract features from images and classify the pulmonary nodules. Based on the developed model, pulmonary nodules with various features have been successfully classified with 86% accuracy, demonstrating superior performance.

Experiments have shown metallic-like and semiconducting charge transport regimes in OMCs, mediated by free electrons with Bloch-like oscillations (BOs) and polaronic states. In metallic-like regimes, the charge propagates as a wave, while in semiconducting regimes, it travels as a quasi-particle coupling charge with a cloud of lattice phonons. While the conditions for polaronic states in OMCs are well-established, those enabling BOs still need to be understood. In this study, we identify the electronic and structural properties of OMCs that favor the formation of polarons or BOs by analyzing their linear and wave transport properties. We employ semiempirical non-adiabatic dynamical simulations at the picosecond scale and machine learning methods to map the parameter spaces where the charge transport occurs via polarons or BOs. The dynamical simulations are based on a general model Hamiltonian developed to address OMCs. Our results reveal that increasing the electronic transfer rate between molecules, the crystal's speed of sound, and its metallicity favors the formation of BOs. BOs in OMCs can exhibit frequencies around 2 THz and current amplitudes up to 3000 |e| ps-1, opening up possibilities for high-frequency applications.

The computational complexity of a DNN-based image classifier is higher than traditional fully connected (FC) feed-forward NNs. Therefore, dedicated cloud servers and graphical processor units (GPUs) are utilized to achieve high-speed and large-capacity computation tasks in machine vision systems. However, a growing demand exists for real-time processing of complex machine-learning tasks on embedded systems. As FC layers consume the highest fraction of computational power and memory footprint, innovating novel power-efficient and low-footprint NN architecture for embedded systems is crucial. In this letter, a pipelined and parallel fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based FC-DNN architecture is implemented on Stratix-10 FPGA using VHDL. The footprint of the DNN is further reduced using a folded FFT network. The proposed algorithm is tested using two benchmark training set examples, the MNIST database of handwritten digits and the CIFAR-10 database.

The disease arises due to abnormal growth of tissue formed of malignant cells. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for enhancing the survival rate. Therefore, artificial intelligence has revolutionized healthcare and can serve as a promising tool for early diagnosis. The present study aims to develop a machine-learning model to classify breast cancer and to provide explanations for the model results. This could improve the understanding of the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by identifying the most important features of breast cancer tumors and the way they affect the classification task. The best-performing machine-learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.7% using k-nearest neighbors and a precision of 98.2% based on the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and an accuracy of 98.6% using the artificial neural network with 94.4% precision based on the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset. Hence, this asserts the importance and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The present research explains the model behavior using model-agnostic methods, demonstrating that the bare nuclei feature in the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset and the area‚Äôs worst feature Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset are the most important factors in determining breast cancer malignancy. The work provides extensive insights into the particular characteristics of the diagnosis of breast cancer and suggests possible directions for expected investigation in the future into the fundamental biological mechanisms that underlie the disease‚Äôs onset.

Al2O3 and TiO2 nanoparticles (13 and 21 nm, respectively) were dispersed in water to prepare the nanofluids in the concentrations range of 0 to 1 vol%. Thermal conductivity and viscosity are measured in the temperature range of 30 to 60oC for the prepared nanofluids. Experimental and numerical analyses explored the effect of concentration and Reynolds number on Nusselt number, entropy generation, and friction factor. The results demonstrate that maximum viscosity enhancement of 15.77 and 14.76% is observed for 1 vol% of hybrid nanofluid and Al2O3 nanofluid compared to base fluid at 30 oC, respectively. The maximum Nusselt number enchantment is 70.4% for 1 vol% of hybrid nanofluid compared to the water. Similarly, hybrid nanofluids achieved a remarkable reduction in total entropy generation of 46% in contrast to the base fluid. New correlations are proposed to predict both the Nusselt number and friction factor for hybrid nanofluids. Furthermore, employing machine learning techniques, highly accurate models are developed.

The results of robust features were also compared with conventional techniques without considering the robustness of radiomic features. Methods An in-house developed lung phantom was developed with two 22mm lesion sizes based on a clinical study. A specific motor was built to simulate motion in two orthogonal directions. Lesions of both clinical and phantom studies were segmented using a Fuzzy C-means-based segmentation algorithm. After inducing motion and extracting 105 radiomic features in 4 feature sets, including shape, first-, second-, and higher-order statistics features from each region of interest (ROI) of the phantom image, statistical analyses were performed to select robust features against motion. Subsequently, these robust features and a total of 105 radiomic features were extracted from 126 clinical data. Various feature selection (FS) and multiple machine learning (ML) classifiers were implemented to predict the LVI of NSCLC, followed by comparing the results of predicting LVI using robust features with common conventional techniques not considering the robustness of radiomic features. Results Our results demonstrated that selecting robust features as input to FS algorithms and ML classifiers surges the sensitivity, which has a gentle negative effect on the accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) of predictions compared with commonly used methods in 12 of 15 outcomes. The top performance of the LVI prediction was achieved by the NB classifier and RFE FS without considering the robustness of radiomic features with 95% area under the curve of AUC, 67% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Moreover, the top performance of the LVI prediction using robust features belonged to the NB classifier and Boruta feature selection with 92% AUC, 86% accuracy, and 100% sensitivity. Conclusion Robustness over various influential factors is critical and should be considered in a radiomic study. Selecting robust features is a solution to overcome the low reproducibility of radiomic features. Although setting robust features against motion in a phantom study has a minor negative impact on the accuracy and AUC of LVI prediction, it boosts the sensitivity of prediction to a large extent.', 'authors': ['Seyyed Ali Hosseini', 'G.

We propose an approach that efficiently manages this trade-off. By enhancing a pretrained non-streaming model, which was trained with a seq2seq mechanism and represents the upper bound in quality, we convert it into a streaming model by utilizing the alignment between source and target tokens. This alignment is used to learn a read/write decision boundary for reliable translation generation with minimal input. During training, the model learns the decision boundary through a read/write policy module, employing supervised learning on the alignment points (pseudo labels). The read/write policy module, a small binary classification unit, can control the quality/latency trade-off during inference.

Multiplicative scatter correction (MSC) preprocessing significantly improved the recognition effect of all four models, with the 1DCNN model demonstrating the highest accuracy and most stable recognition performance. The effects of feature bands extracted using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), variable importance in projection (VIP), and local linear embedding (LLE) on the four models were also compared. The accuracy of all four feature band sets, when combined with the MSC+1DCNN model, exceeded 96% in identifying soybean varieties.

We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.\", 'authors': ['Lisa Barros de Andrade e Sousa', 'Gregor Miller', 'Ronan Le Gleut', 'Dominik Thalmeier', 'Helena Pelin', 'Marie Piraud'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': '', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002c2e20bc4d2d973c6aea6eac6af8fd46189936', 'external_ids': {'ArXiv': '2507.19455', 'CorpusId': 280046134}, 'doi': None, 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616905', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPFSAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPFSAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f027be9-0000-0200-0000-689e78fd0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216125}, {'id': 'c7f1eb7b3c1fdee289d11019427f9e5b0b3c0b318e85f8206e2c9c0ffe6e2f3e', 'paper_id': '002d16e3c70410a80bcd25758ccb4f8ca3854136', 'title': 'Leveraging Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance in Pharmaceutical Production', 'abstract': 'In the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, predictive maintenance (PdM) is an evolving approach that employs machine learning (ML) integrated with IoT data collection to mitigate equipment malfunctions and improve operational efficiency.

Various prediction models, including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and a stacked model, were employed and evaluated using performance metrics like R¬≤ score and mean squared error. The results demonstrate the models‚Äô ability to accurately predict boat speed. Anomaly detection techniques examined boat stability, adding a new chapter to the research. Additionally, we introduced a reinforcement learning approach to identify optimal settings for speed enhancement, representing another new dimension of the study.

In this work, I present a lightweight exponential-weighted ensemble framework that combines multiple base classifiers‚ÄîK-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting‚Äîthrough a simple yet effective reweighting scheme applied offline. This method assigns exponential penalties based on each model‚Äôs validation error and then aggregates their probability outputs in the test phase. Unlike more complex stacking or multi-layer ensembles, the proposed approach does not require a separate meta-learner, enabling straightforward implementation and reduced computational overhead. The system is evaluated on a well-known dataset available on Kaggle, achieving a final accuracy of 99.8%, which meets or exceeds the performance of more elaborate ensembles. Although the current study focuses on an offline learning setting, the exponential-weighting mechanism naturally extends to online or incremental learning scenarios, wherein model weights can be easily updated as new data arrive. This adaptability, coupled with excellent predictive accuracy, makes the approach highly suitable for real-world smart farming applications where conditions and data streams are subject to continuous change.', 'authors': ['Luisa Stracqualursi'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Journal of Agricultural Biological and Environmental Statistics', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003418153af17e03f90029c0e9cad946517eaa3d', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.1007/s13253-025-00694-6', 'CorpusId': 278197905}, 'doi': '10.1007/s13253-025-00694-6', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.616995', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPFcAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPFcAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02afe9-0000-0200-0000-689e78fe0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216126}, {'id': '0a340e62d7015340d7c76aabbd3400f9082c6baded30799a1f39a6327b204a31', 'paper_id': '00355494aac8f634cd5ff43efcde57f35f9bfe42', 'title': 'Improving machine learning-based bitewing segmentation with synthetic data.', 'abstract': None, 'authors': ['E.

Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14\\u2009months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000\\u2009cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.\", 'authors': ['R. C. M.

Specifically, $K$ clients have each $n$ training samples generated independently according to a possibly different data distribution, and their individually chosen models are aggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between the clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated model. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the generalization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend the popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound, which was developed for the centralized learning setting, i.e., $K=1$, to the distributed learning setting with an arbitrary number of clients $K \\\\geq 1$. Then, we connect with information-theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter \\\\textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to study the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization error for the distributed classification problem in which each client uses Support Vector Machines (DSVM). In this case, we establish explicit generalization error bounds that depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity degree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data heterogeneity across clients increases, thereby suggesting that DSVM generalizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples is bigger. This finding, which goes beyond DSVM, is validated experimentally through several experiments.\", 'authors': ['Masoud Kavian', 'Milad Sefidgaran', 'Abdellatif Zaidi', 'Romain Chor'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'arXiv.org', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003bfdcb01115ac4c5e899fa1726a95e93d2c785', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2503-01598', 'ArXiv': '2503.01598', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2503.01598', 'CorpusId': 276774268}, 'doi': '10.48550/arXiv.2503.01598', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617046', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPFlAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPFlAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02ede9-0000-0200-0000-689e78fe0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216126}, {'id': '22000e665a5f49f825654b6423e2ba7f9083d9895879753fa698e0c21f73ad9e', 'paper_id': '003c1effbffad399f0f19a380ed8cea28a3bc2c4', 'title': 'Deep Learning Recommender Systems', 'abstract': 'Recommender systems are ubiquitous in modern life and are one of the main monetization channels for Internet technology giants.

A comprehensive feature engineering analysis identified an optimal set of input variables‚Äîdiameter, penetration, observed blow count, and maximum energy recorded at the sensor level (EMX)‚Äîto enhance model accuracy.\\n The machine learning models demonstrated high accuracy and reliability in predicting soil resistance, with Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) ranging from 10.9% to 14.8% and Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤) between 78.7% and 89.6% during testing. Specifically, the proposed model using the selected input features achieved an R¬≤ of 89.6% and a MAPE of 10.9%. These results indicate that the data-driven approach significantly enhances the precision of soil resistance predictions, reducing reliance on conservative assumptions typically made in pile design and drivability analyses.', 'authors': ['A.

Due to the limitations of current diagnostic tools in these cases, novel approaches must be brought forward to improve treatment outcomes for these patients. The objective of this study was to develop a machine-learning-based software for primary cancer site prediction (OncoOrigin), based on genetic data acquired from tumor DNA sequencing. By design, this was an in silico diagnostic study, conducted using data from the cBioPortal database (accessed on 21 September 2024) and several data processing and machine learning Python libraries. The study involved over 20,000 tumor samples with information on patient age, sex, and the presence of genetic variants in over 600 genes. The main outcome of interest was machine-learning-based discrimination between cancer site classes. Model quality was assessed by training set cross-validation and evaluation on a segregated test set. Finally, the optimal model was incorporated with a graphical user interface into the OncoOrigin software. Feature importance for class discrimination was also determined on the optimal model. Out of the four tested machine learning estimators, the XGBoostClassifier-based model proved superior in test set evaluation, with a top-2 accuracy of 0.91 and ROC-AUC of 0.97. Unlike other machine learning models published in the literature, OncoOrigin stands out as the only one integrated with a graphical user interface, which is crucial for facilitating its use by oncology specialists in everyday clinical practice, where its application and implementation will have the greatest value in the future.', 'authors': ['P.

To this end, many Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management systems (UTM) have been designed. These systems use various methods for managing UAV conflicts. Several surveys have reviewed conflict resolution methods for UAVs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no survey specifically addressing conflict detection and resolution methods in UTM, particularly those using AI-based methods. Therefore, this article serves as a comprehensive survey of all UAVs conflicts detection and resolution methods proposed in the literature and their use in the UTM systems. This survey classifies the methods into two categories: classical (non-learning) methods and learning-based methods. Classical methods typically rely on pre-defined algorithms or rules for UAVs to avoid collisions, whereas Artificial Intelligence-based methods, including Machine Learning (ML) and especially Reinforcement Learning (RL), enable UAVs to adapt to their environment, autonomously resolve conflicts, and exhibit intelligent behavior based on their experiences. It also presents their application in the conflict resolution service for UTMs. Additionally, the challenges and issues associated with each type of methods are discussed.

Food safety in these commodities is crucial, as they are highly susceptible to mold growth and mycotoxin contamination in warm, humid environments. This review explores hyperspectral imaging (HSI) integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms as a promising approach for detecting and quantifying mycotoxins in cereal grains and nuts. This study aims to (1) critically evaluate current non-destructive techniques for processing these foods and the applications of ML in identifying mycotoxins through HSI, and (2) highlight challenges and potential future research directions to enhance the reliability and efficiency of these detection systems. The ML algorithms showed effectiveness in classifying and quantifying mycotoxins in grains and nuts, with HSI systems increasingly adopted in industrial settings. Mycotoxins exhibit heightened sensitivity to specific spectral bands within HSI, facilitating accurate detection. Additionally, selecting only relevant spectral features reduces ML model complexity and enhances reliability in the detection process.

Existing ML-based approaches, however, are marred by two inherent weaknesses: (1) Lack of granularity in detection because most models are based on binary classification, with no distinction of botnet attack variants, and (2) Uninterpretability, where high-performing AI models behave like black-box mechanisms, which limits trust in security automation and leads to high false positives, thereby making threat analysis difficult for security practitioners.\\n\\nTo overcome these challenges, this study proposes an AI-based, multi-class classification botnet detection system for encrypted network traffic that includes Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for improving model explainability and decision transparency. Two datasets, CICIDS-2017 and CTU-NCC, are used in this study, where a systematic data preprocessing step was employed to maximise data quality, feature representation, and model performance. Preprocessing included duplicate record removal, missing and infinite value imputation, categorical feature transformation, and removal of highly correlated and zero-variance features to minimise model bias. Dimensionality reduction was performed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), lowering features of CICIDS-2017 from 70 to 34 and those of CTU-NCC from 17 to 4 for maximizing computational efficiency. Additionally, to deal with skewed class distributions, Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) was employed to synthesise minority class samples to offer balanced representation of botnet attack types.\\n\\nFor CICIDS-2017, we used three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF) with cross-validation (0.98 accuracy, 100K samples per class), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) with Bayesian optimisation (0.997 accuracy, 180K samples per class), and our recently introduced Hybrid K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN) + Random Forest (RF) model, resulting in state-of-the-art accuracy of 0.99 (180K samples per class). The CTU-NCC dataset was divided across three network sensors and processed separately. Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), and KNN models were trained independently for each sensor, and to enhance performance, ensemble learning methods such as stacking and voting were applied to combine the results from each of the sensors. The resulting accuracies were as follows: (Random Forest Stacking: 99.38%, Random Forest Voting: 99.35% ), (Decision Tree Stacking: 99.68%, Decision Tree Voting: 91.65%), and (KNN Stacking: 97.53%, KNN Voting: 97.11%). Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model agnostic Explanation) were integrated to provide enhanced interpretability in eXtreme Gradient Boosting and our Hybrid KNN+Random Forest model, which provided explanations for model decisions and enhanced analyst confidence in the system prediction.\\n\\nOur key contribution is the Hybrid KNN+Random Forest system with 0.99 accuracy and provision of explainability. We illustrate an accurate, scalable, and deployable AI-based solution for botnet attacks. Our experimentation shows that the multi-class classification method greatly assists in botnet attack discrimination, and Explainable AI (XAI) helps enhance clarity and is thus a strong, practical solution in the real case of botnet detection in an encrypted network scenario.', 'authors': ['Vishva Patel', 'Hitasvi Shukla', 'Aashka Raval'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'International Journal For Multidisciplinary Research', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004414650df706d85b2884d5df519515339e281f', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i02.39353', 'CorpusId': 277180364}, 'doi': '10.36948/ijfmr.2025.v07i02.39353', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617119', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPFyAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPFyAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0241ea-0000-0200-0000-689e78fe0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216126}, {'id': 'b716d59594e04833c66a3ec0eb78cce6e5ed6896e05a18d0f743c525cc3f54b1', 'paper_id': '0044c875dcfba848be8e10999f5e6b0fcc47e2b1', 'title': 'Optimizing Flamelet Generated Manifold Models: A Machine Learning Performance Study', 'abstract': 'In chemistry tabulations and Flamelet combustion models, the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) is recognized for its precision and physical representation.

Due to the absence of well-established theoretical frameworks and publicly available feature databases on power demand changes, the known interpretable features of power demand fluctuations are primarily derived from expert experience and remain significantly limited. This substantially hinders advancements in power demand forecasting accuracy. Emerging multimodal learning approaches have demonstrated great promise in machine learning and AI-generated content (AIGC). In this paper, we propose, for the first time, a textual-knowledge-guided numerical feature discovery (TKNFD) framework for short-term power demand forecasting by interacting text modal data‚Äîa potentially valuable yet long-overlooked resource in the field of power demand forecasting‚Äîwith numerical modal data. TKNFD systematically and automatically aggregates qualitative textual knowledge, expands it into a candidate feature-type set, collects corresponding numerical data for these features, and ultimately constructs four-dimensional multivariate source-tracking databases (4DM-STDs). Subsequently, TKNFD introduces a two-stage quantitative feature identification strategy that operates independently of forecasting models. The essence of TKNFD lies in achieving reliable and comprehensive feature discovery by fully exploiting the dual relationships of synonymy and complementarity between text modal data and numerical modal data in terms of granularity, scope, and temporality. In this study, TKNFD identifies 38‚Äì50 features while further interpreting their contributions and dependency correlations. Benchmark experiments conducted in Maine, Texas, and New South Wales demonstrate that the forecasting accuracy using TKNFD-identified features consistently surpasses that of state-of-the-art feature schemes by up to 36.37% MAPE. Notably, driven by multimodal interaction, TKNFD can discover previously unknown interpretable features without relying on prior empirical knowledge. This study reveals 10‚Äì16 previously unknown interpretable features, particularly several dominant features in integrated energy and astronomical dimensions. These discoveries enhance our understanding of the origins of strong randomness and non-linearity in power demand fluctuations.

Radar-based recognition surpasses traditional optical methods, offering robust interaction capabilities in diverse environments. This article introduces a novel deep learning approach for hand gesture recognition, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and attention mechanisms. CNNs extract spatial features from radar signals, while LSTMs model the temporal dependencies crucial for dynamic gestures. Additionally, attention mechanisms enhance feature selection, ultimately improving recognition performance. We evaluate our method on the UWB-Gestures dataset, which has 12 gestures from eight people that were recorded using three X-Thru X4 UWB impulse radar sensors. Our processing pipeline integrates feature extraction, LSTM-attention blocks, and dense layers for final classification. Early fusion techniques, which combine spatial and temporal features in the initial stages, yield superior results, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.33% and outperforming intermediate fusion methods across gesture classes.

Recently, several efficient link prediction algorithms have been developed, demonstrating robust results in both prediction accuracy and interpretability. However, existing research has not clearly established the relationship between network characteristics and link creation mechanisms. The ability to predict complex networks with diverse features still requires further investigation. In light of this, we introduce a novel framework designed to combine the best features of different link prediction algorithms when applied to the network, with the aim of achieving more reliable predictions about how networks will evolve in consequence. According to the proposed framework, this first focuses on the feature extraction stage. During this phase, we systematically identify and extract a comprehensive set of features from the network before moving on to the classification phase. Here, we utilize state-of-the-art ensemble learning models to assess and classify potential links within the network. By training our Machine Learning (ML) models on the extracted features, we can effectively predict whether a particular link is likely to form (positive link) or unlikely to form (negative link). The ML models were trained and evaluated using two datasets: Twitch and Facebook. Additionally, we assessed their performance on these datasets by conducting specific preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning steps.

Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358).

Existing algorithmic fairness algorithms in federated learning primarily focus on mitigating inherent biases within the training data or biases introduced by non-IID data distributions. However, these methods heavily rely on the assumption of trust and cooperation among participants in federated learning, leaving a notable gap in exploring the robustness of algorithmic fairness under adversarial environments. Therefore, our study advocates the exploration of the robustness of algorithmic fairness in federated learning. We first introduce four types of fairness attacks targeting the fairness of federated learning models. Then, we propose FairGuard, an innovative defense framework designed to counter these attacks. FairGuard employs a novel dual-inference algorithm that effectively identifies malicious clients during the global aggregation phase of federated learning. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the introduced fairness attacks significantly compromise the global model's fairness and cannot be effectively mitigated by existing defense mechanisms, while FairGuard exhibits remarkable effectiveness in defending against these fairness attacks.\", 'authors': ['Xinyi Sheng', 'Zhengjie Yang', 'Wei Bao'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0051c465ad7737cc98aabf88b3c942849c26f90b', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'journals/tdsc/ShengYB25', 'DOI': '10.1109/TDSC.2024.3520134', 'CorpusId': 274913612}, 'doi': '10.1109/TDSC.2024.3520134', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617221', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPGBAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPGBAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f029fea-0000-0200-0000-689e78ff0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216127}, {'id': '2603d7373ff7335545baf9e87687b0317606121b75b8d87d0f7274c9988ad2e4', 'paper_id': '00528c001a64f5b6ca72d12d9d8b1449907e16a0', 'title': \"That's What RoBERTa Said: Explainable Classification of Peer Feedback\", 'abstract': 'Peer feedback (PF) is essential for improving student learning outcomes, particularly in Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) settings.

Effective monitoring of underwater environments is essential to improve fish quality and farming efficiency. A crucial part of this process is the accurate classification of fish and non-fish objects. This study proposes a method for underwater classification using morphometric feature extraction and machine learning techniques. The research process involves six main steps: (1) preparation of Region of Interest (ROI) detection data, (2) extraction of morphometric features‚Äîlength (L) and width (W), (3) feature computation, (4) data partitioning for training and testing, (5) classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and (6) evaluation using a confusion matrix.

Recently, Machine Learning (ML) based techniques have been proposed and evaluated using open-source projects and their test histories. We report our evaluation of these ML-based TCP techniques, both Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Learning (SL) based ones, using the industrial testing data collected from SAP HANA, a large-scale database management system. Specifically, our study compares 37 different TCP techniques, including 14 RL models on two datasets, 4 SL models, and 5 non-ML baselines, using real-world testing data of SAP HANA collected over eight months. Our evaluation focuses on both the performance and cost-efficiency of these techniques in the context of Continuous Integration for large-scale industrial projects. The results reveal that while RL models show promising performance, they require significant training time. RL models with sampled data offer a balance between performance and efficiency. Interestingly, the best-performing RL model outperformed or matched non-ML baselines. However, the gradient-boosted SL technique consistently outperformed both RL models and baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, even with complete retraining at each test cycle. Despite RL's capability for incremental learning, it demands substantial training time and still falls short in accuracy compared to SL. Our findings suggest that, even in a large-scale industrial setting, fully retraining an SL model for each cycle proves to be the most effective and efficient approach for TCP, offering superior performance and cost-efficiency compared to RL and traditional methods.\", 'authors': ['Jeongki Son', 'Gabin An', 'Jingun Hong', 'Shin Yoo'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'International Conference on Information Control Systems & Technologies', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0058ba1241b34b12175971626088acd19f96bd76', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'conf/icst/SonAHY25', 'DOI': '10.1109/ICST62969.2025.10989019', 'CorpusId': 278778465}, 'doi': '10.1109/ICST62969.2025.10989019', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617259', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPGIAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPGIAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02dbea-0000-0200-0000-689e78ff0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216127}, {'id': '20d9f98df54e4a0a2ff7d07eac372f08810f7d122bdfce1b60f0fd62dc940c19', 'paper_id': '005956326ee3cbe11deff1fdb1068bd7a4feb2e0', 'title': 'Trace Gadgets: Minimizing Code Context for Machine Learning-Based Vulnerability Prediction', 'abstract': \"As the number of web applications and API endpoints exposed to the Internet continues to grow, so does the number of exploitable vulnerabilities. Manually identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones. This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.\", 'authors': ['Felix M√§chtle', 'Nils Loose', 'Tim Schulz', 'Florian Sieck', 'Jan-Niclas Serr', 'Ralf M√∂ller', 'Thomas Eisenbarth'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'arXiv.org', 'citation_count': 1, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005956326ee3cbe11deff1fdb1068bd7a4feb2e0', 'external_ids': {'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2504-13676', 'ArXiv': '2504.13676', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2504.13676', 'CorpusId': 277940413}, 'doi': '10.48550/arXiv.2504.13676', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617264', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPGJAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPGJAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f02e3ea-0000-0200-0000-689e78ff0000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216127}, {'id': '42d1d32c0038333730117d832dac23fd09a0222c084b8273d63e2b8a5f20dfe3', 'paper_id': '00596ea65e3be036db07d6de4b2e2796bc098978', 'title': 'Brain Tumor Detection Using ML', 'abstract': 'This research presents a machine learning-based system for automated brain tumor detection using MRI scans.

This paper compares traditional methods, such as Lee-Carter and Gompertz-Makeham, with new frameworks, such as those developed by the Big Life Project, the Global Burden of Disease, and the UK Biobank, through machine learning. Traditional models are noted for being easy to understand, reliable over time, and familiar to most economists. On the other hand, they are getting less able to adjust to the many dimensions, individuality, and changing aspects of the current health challenges patients face. These current strategies use big data from biomedical fields, AI, and new technologies to individually predict how long patients may live. This information is used in these models to help them make more flexible and appropriate predictions. In addition to making medical care safer and more precise, modern models bring difficulties linked to bias in algorithms, problems with understanding their results, protection of patient data, and the necessary computing power. This paper compares different paradigms using several measures, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages, as well as the areas in which they overlap. Combining the old demographic approach with the predictive power of machine learning could be the best direction for analysis. The article highlights that to overcome the ethical, technical, and broader usage issues of current models, it is important to properly adapt them, make their design clear, and involve everyone in data management.

This paper explores a novel automated framework using deep learning to accurately evaluate PD-L1 expression from whole slide images (WSIs) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aiming to improve the precision and consistency of Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) evaluation, which is essential for determining patient eligibility for immunotherapy. Automating TPS evaluation can enhance accuracy and consistency while reducing pathologists' workload. The proposed automated framework encompasses three stages: identifying tumor patches, segmenting tumor areas, and detecting cell nuclei within these areas, followed by estimating the TPS based on the ratio of positively stained to total viable tumor cells. This study utilized a Reference Medicine (Phoenix, Arizona) dataset containing 66 NSCLC tissue samples, adopting a hybrid human-machine approach for annotating extensive WSIs. Patches of size 1000x1000 pixels were generated to train classification models such as EfficientNet, Inception, and Vision Transformer models. Additionally, segmentation performance was evaluated across various UNet and DeepLabV3 architectures, and the pre-trained StarDist model was employed for nuclei detection, replacing traditional watershed techniques. PD-L1 expression was categorized into three levels based on TPS: negative expression (TPS < 1%), low expression (TPS 1-49%), and high expression (TPS ‚â• 50%). The Vision Transformer-based model excelled in classification, achieving an F1-score of 97.54%, while the modified DeepLabV3+ model led in segmentation, attaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 83.47%. The TPS predicted by the framework closely correlated with the pathologist's TPS at 0.9635, and the framework's three-level classification F1-score was 93.89%. The proposed deep learning framework for automatically evaluating the TPS of PD-L1 expression in NSCLC demonstrated promising performance. This framework presents a potential tool that could produce clinically significant results more efficiently and cost-effectively.\", 'authors': ['Saidul Kabir', 'Muhammad E. H.

Concurrently, researchers have identified that social determinants of health (SDOH) (employment status, family income and poverty ratio, food security, education level, access to healthcare services, health insurance, housing conditions, and marital status) are associated with the progression of many chronic diseases. However, there is a paucity of research examining the influence of SDOH on cancer incidence risk and the survival of cancer survivors. The aim of this study was to utilize SDOH as a primary predictive factor, integrated with machine learning models, to forecast both cancer risk and prognostic survival. This research is grounded in the SDOH data derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset spanning 1999 to 2018. It employs methodologies including adaptive boosting, gradient boosting machine (GradientBoosting), random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, support vector machine, and logistic regression to develop models for predicting cancer risk and prognostic survival. The hyperparameters of these models‚Äîspecifically, the number of estimators (100‚Äì200), maximum tree depth (10), learning rate (0.01‚Äì0.2), and regularization parameters‚Äîwere optimized through grid search and cross-validation, followed by performance evaluation. Shapley Additive exPlanations plots were generated to visualize the influence of each feature. RF was the best model for predicting cancer risk (area under the curve: 0.92, accuracy: 0.84). Age, non-Hispanic White, sex, and housing status were the 4 most important characteristics of the RF model. Age, gender, employment status, and household income/poverty ratio were the 4 most important features in the gradient boosting machine model. The predictive models developed in this study exhibited strong performance in estimating cancer incidence risk and survival time, identifying several factors that significantly influence both cancer incidence risk and survival, thereby providing new evidence for cancer management. Despite the promising findings, this study acknowledges certain limitations, including the omission of risk factors in the cancer survivor survival model and potential biases inherent in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset.

However, the approaches and methods in doing so vary vastly between the two fields. In this paper, we explore integrating the knowledge from the ML domain to provide empirical evaluations of cryptosystems. Particularly, we utilize information theoretic metrics to perform ML-based distribution estimation. We propose two novel applications of ML algorithms that can be applied in a known plaintext setting to perform cryptanalysis on any cryptosystem. We use mutual information neural estimation to calculate a cryptosystem's mutual information leakage, and a binary cross entropy classification to model an indistinguishability under chosen plaintext attack (CPA). These algorithms can be readily applied in an audit setting to evaluate the robustness of a cryptosystem and the results can provide a useful empirical bound. We evaluate the efficacy of our methodologies by empirically analyzing several encryption schemes. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to novel network coding-based cryptosystems and provide other use cases for our algorithms. We show that our classification model correctly identifies the encryption schemes that are not IND-CPA secure, such as DES, RSA, and AES ECB, with high accuracy. It also identifies the faults in CPA-secure cryptosystems with faulty parameters, such a reduced counter version of AES-CTR. We also conclude that with our algorithms, in most cases a smaller-sized neural network using less computing power can identify vulnerabilities in cryptosystems, providing a quick check of the sanity of the cryptosystem and help to decide whether to spend more resources to deploy larger networks that are able to break the cryptosystem.\", 'authors': ['Benjamin D.

Additionally, real time monitoring system has the ability to help farms with precision farming by recommending tailored solutions to farmers through user friendly interfaces on smartphones and other digital devices. Case studies conducted at a variety of different agricultural sites of smallholdings as well as large scale are used to validate the system's effectiveness. The preliminary results suggest that crop productivity as well as the cost efficiency are significantly improved.

Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024) showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over 500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's developmental experiences.\", 'authors': ['Wai Keen Vong', 'B.

The data of 2134 patients diagnosed with alcoholic cirrhosis (AC) were obtained from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, extreme gradient boosting, Logistic Regression and support vector machines were employed to develop the prediction model. The model was trained on 70% of the data and validated on the remaining 30% randomly. Performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). SHAP analysis was used to assess the marginal effects of each independent variable. The mean age was 56.2 years, and 69.5% were male. The primary factors associated with 28-day mortality included Age, SOFA score, ASPIII score, OASIS score, LODS score, Temperature, Chloride, Lactate, Total bilirubin (Tbil), international normalized ratio (INR), Activated partial thromboplastin time (Aptt), Stroke, Malignancy, Congenital coagulation defect (Ccd). The machine learning model demonstrated good predictive performance in the training and validation group, higher than traditional MELD score. Our machine learning prediction model effectively identifies patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at high risk of 28-day mortality. This model could assist clinicians in early risk stratification and guide clinical decision-making. Further validation in external cohorts is warranted to confirm its generalizability.

Public health interventions have shown only moderate success, possibly from relying on knowledge extracted using limited types of statistical data analysis methods. Purpose To explore if multimodal machine learning can enhance identifying predictive features from obesogenic environments and investigating complex disease or social patterns, using the Mexican National Health and Nutrition Survey. Methods We grouped features into five data modalities corresponding to paediatric population exogenous factors, in two multimodal machine learning pipelines, against a unimodal early fusion baseline. The supervised pipeline employed four methods: Linear classifier with Elastic Net regularisation, k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The unsupervised pipeline used traditional methods with k-Means and hierarchical clustering, with the optimal number of clusters calculated to be k = 2. Results The decision tree classifier in the supervised early fusion approach produced the best quantitative results. The top five most important features for classifying child or adolescent health were measures of an adult in the household, selected at random: BMI, obesity diagnosis, being single, seeking care at private healthcare, and having paid TV in the home. Unsupervised learning approaches varied in the optimal number of clusters but agreed on the importance of home environment features when analysing inter-cluster patterns. Main findings from this study differed from previous studies using only traditional statistical methods on the same database. Notably, the BMI of a randomised adult within the household emerged as the most important feature, rather than maternal BMI, as reported in previous literature where unwanted cultural bias went undetected. Conclusion Our general conclusion is that multimodal machine learning is a promising approach for comprehensively analysing obesogenic environments. The modalities allowed for a multimodal approach designed to critically analyse data signal strength and reveal sources of unwanted bias. In particular, it may aid in developing more effective public health policies to address the ongoing paediatric obesity epidemic in Mexico.', 'authors': ['Rosario Silva Sepulveda', 'Magnus Boman'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'Frontiers in Public Health', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006961bbefde718be28a42c7170db2a0aaa42a03', 'external_ids': {'PubMedCentral': '11752892', 'DOI': '10.3389/fpubh.2024.1369041', 'CorpusId': 275376134, 'PubMed': '39845684'}, 'doi': '10.3389/fpubh.2024.1369041', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617408', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPGkAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPGkAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0272eb-0000-0200-0000-689e79000000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216128}, {'id': 'ce3609737a0cfe5f9413a6769e1571cbb929cb225df07c48157501196c9c50ea', 'paper_id': '0069a6b716efaa6925408073be59630c3615c70b', 'title': 'Towards Accurate Machine-learning-assisted Aging Prediction with Probabilistic Strategy', 'abstract': None, 'authors': ['Xiaoxiao Qiu', 'Daoda An', 'Yixian Wang', 'P.

A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification. To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction error.

Identifying mental health disorders at an early stage allows healthcare professionals to implement more targeted and impactful interventions, leading to a significant improvement in the overall well-being of the patient. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have opened new avenues for analyzing medical records and behavioral data of patients to assist mental health professionals in their decision-making processes. In this study performance of four Randomized Neural Networks (RandNNs) such as Board Learning System (BLS), Random Vector Functional Link Network (RVFLN), Kernelized RVFLN (KRVFLN), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are explored for detecting the type of mental illness a user may have by analyzing the random text of the user posted on social media. To improve the performance of the RandNNs during handling the text documents with unbalanced class distributions, a hybrid feature selection (FS) technique named as TOPSIS-ModCHI is suggested in the preprocessing stage of the classification framework. The effectiveness of the suggested FS with all the four randomized networks is assessed over the publicly available Reddit Mental Health Dataset after experimenting on two benchmark multiclass unbalanced datasets. From the experimental results, it is inferred that detecting the mental illness using BLS with TOPSIS-ModCHI produces the highest precision value of 0.92, recall value of 0.66, f-measure value of 0.77, and Hamming loss value of 0.06 as compared to ELM, RVFLN, and KRVFLN with a minimum feature size of 900.

Furthermore, S-ketamine exposure constantly activates microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mediating excessive synaptic pruning and dendritic structural abnormalities, leading to overexcitation of excitatory synaptic transmission.

To facilitate high quality input to the machine learning models, the proposed system makes use of Python based tools and libraries to pre process raw medical datasets, eliminate inconsistencies, normalize features, and extract useful attributes. As the core predictive algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), have shown to be highly effective in classification tasks, are used. The design is modular system and provides seamless data cleaning, prediction, and evaluation process integration which leads to scalability between health care domain. Benchmark datasets were used for experimental validation which showed the superior diagnostic accuracy, precision and reliability compared to both existing models and other previously demonstrated methods. In summary, the work presented in this project is a next step towards making hospitalization healthcare diagnostics data driven, scalable, and intelligent decision support systems in order to improve patient care and outcomes.', 'authors': ['G.

In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge, an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent, a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results--posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation.

To address these issues, we propose LatMixSol, a novel latent space augmentation framework that combines autoencoder-based feature compression with guided interpolation to enrich training data. Our approach first encodes molecular descriptors into a low-dimensional latent space using a two-layer autoencoder. Spectral clustering is then applied to group chemically similar molecules, enabling targeted MixUp-style interpolation within clusters. Synthetic samples are generated by blending latent vectors of cluster members and decoding them back to the original feature space. Evaluated on the Huuskonen solubility benchmark, LatMixSol demonstrates consistent improvements across three of four gradient-boosted regressors (CatBoost, LightGBM, HistGradientBoosting), achieving RMSE reductions of 3.2-7.6% and R-squared increases of 0.5-1.5%. Notably, HistGradientBoosting shows the most significant enhancement with a 7.6% RMSE improvement.

The study fills the gap of models in accurately predicting steel's performance based on composition since traditional methods cannot fully capture complex relationships between alloying elements and material properties. Various regression models have been used for predicting material properties, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), XGBoost Regression, and Neural Networks, and in this paper, Graph Attention Transformer Network (GAT-TransNet) is proposed. Incorporating novel graph attention into the transformer architecture model, GAT-TransNet handles complex data relationships and improves predictive accuracy. Data-driven analyses are also carried out alongside regression analysis to establish how alloying elements, such as carbon (C), manganese (Mn), and chromium (Cr), affect steel's mechanical properties strength, yield strength, hardness, and ductility. The study established that the GAT-TransNet model outperformed other regression models, with an R¬≤ score of 0.95, the lowest MAE of 1.40, and an MSE of 4.41, thus underscoring its superior predictive capability compared to existing models. Data-driven insights show that manganese hardens and increases wear resistance, while chromium enhances corrosion resistance and increases tensile strength. This has great importance for optimizing specific steel compositions for industrial applications.

We demonstrate that this capacity scales with nonlinearity to the point where it surpasses the performance of a deep neural network model with five hidden layers on a scalable nonlinear classification benchmark. By comparing normal and anomalous dispersion fibers under various operating conditions and against digital classifiers, we observe a direct correlation between the system‚Äôs nonlinear dynamics and its classification performance.

Arranging the Artificial Intelligence Act of European Union, requirements and a methodology for an approval of measurement devices by a regulatory authority or a state institution need to be developed. In this study, using the example of loudness classification from electroencephalography measurement data, phenomenological methods were developed for the evaluation of ML models in the context of an approval process. A schedule of six sequential steps is proposed that can be used as a flowchart in such a process. After identifying the relevant features (step 1) performance measures and benchmarks were defined (step 2). In the following performance evaluation (step 3) the influence of the input data on the model‚Äôs output was determined. The range and characteristics of the input data at which the device operates correctly were identified and quantitative descriptors were determined for the full range of operating conditions specified in standards or regulations for approval (step 4). Perturbation-based techniques were developed and adapted to define corner cases and to create new test data that identify the areas of the input data where performance falls below a certain threshold (step 5). The newly found test data were finally applied in step 6, and it could be shown that the data can reveal weak points in the models. All processes can and must be used without knowledge of the models, as an independent test of a finished device is always carried out during a type approval.

A finite element model integrating PET foam and epoxy resin was developed and validated against experimental shear modulus data (Œ± < 0.5%). Machine learning combined with a multi-island genetic algorithm (MIGA) optimized groove parameters (spacing: 7.5‚Äì30 mm, width: 0.9‚Äì2 mm, depth: 0‚Äì23.5 mm, perforation angle: 45‚Äì90¬∞) under constant resin infusion. The optimal configuration (width: 1 mm, spacing: 15 mm, angle: 65¬∞) increased the shear modulus by 9.2% (from 125 MPa to 137.1 MPa) and enhanced compressive/tensile modulus by 10.7% compared to conventional designs, without increasing core mass. Stress distribution analysis demonstrated that secondary grooves improved resin infiltration uniformity and interfacial stress transfer, reducing localized strain concentration. Further integration of machine learning with MIGA for parameter optimization enabled the shear modulus to reach 150 MPa while minimizing weight gain, achieving a balance between structural performance and material efficiency.

Pre-procedural 30-day mortality post PCI risk prediction aids in clinical decision-making and benchmarking hospital performance. This study aimed to identify pre-procedural factors to predict the risk of 30-day mortality following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) using machine learning (ML) approaches. Methods The study analysed 93,055 consecutive PCI procedures from the Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry (VCOR) in Australia to develop a pre-procedural 30-day mortality prediction model. Five ML approaches Adaptive Booster (AdB), Decision Tree (DT), Gradient Booster (GB), Random Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Booster (XGB) were employed, utilizing Logistic Regression (LR) for comparison. Model performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, with metrics including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, ROC curve, Brier score, and calibration curve. Results The study showed that the RF model outperformed other ML models in predicting 30-day mortality, achieving accuracy of 98.4% and a ROC of 94.3%. Utilizing the SHapley Additive exPlanations method, the RF model identified cardiogenic shock, ejection fraction, acute coronary syndrome, estimated GFR, cardiac arrest, age, mechanical ventricular support, complex lesion, lesion location, BMI, sex, and diabetes as the variables that were associated with 30-day mortality post-PCI. In comparison, the traditional LR model exhibited an accuracy of 98.2% and a ROC of 92.9%. Conclusion A 30-day mortality post-PCI risk prediction model was developed with high accuracy using a ML method. It's essential to underscore the need for further validation with external data to ensure the applicability of the model to other populations.\", 'authors': ['Mohammad Rocky Khan', 'D.

However, these approaches mostly relied on single-task learning models with black-box nature and often neglected the complex tradeoffs and inter-dependencies between routing metrics. To address these limitations, this article introduces a novel multi-task learning-based routing optimization method. In the congestion-wirelength co-learning stage, the simultaneous prediction of congestion and wirelength is formulated as a multi-task learning problem. A multi-task learning model, named CWNet, is proposed to tackle this challenge effectively. During the congestion-wirelength impact interpretation, the contribution of congestion to wirelength is quantified using an XAI technique known as DeepSHAP, producing a congestion-wirelength impact map. In the congestion-wirelength co-guided routing optimization (CWRO) stage, the VTR router‚Äôs lookahead map is enhanced based on the impact map, guiding the router to avoid locations where congestion significantly affect wirelength. Experimental results demonstrate that CWNet outperforms most baseline learning models in terms of both prediction performance and computational efficiency. Additionally, the impact map visually illustrates the complex and nonlinear relationship between congestion and wirelength. Ultimately, CWRO significantly reduces congestion, wirelength, and critical path delay, while maintaining a competitive runtime compared to baseline routers.', 'authors': ['Wenhao Liu', 'Yan Xing', 'Shuting Cai', 'Weijun Li', 'Xiaoming Xiong'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'ACM Trans.

This is particularly the case for machine learning researchers attempting to improve on the bird species recognition accuracy of classification models. However, the task of extracting labeled datasets from the recordings found in this crowd-sourced repository faces several challenges. One challenge of particular significance to machine learning practitioners is that one bird species label is applied to each audio recording, but frequently other sounds are also captured including other bird species, other animal sounds, anthropogenic and other ambient sounds. These non-target bird species sounds can result in dataset labeling discrepancies referred to as label noise. In this work we present a cleaning process consisting of audio preprocessing followed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised outlier detection (UOD) to reduce the label noise in a dataset derived from Xeno-Canto recordings. We investigate three neural network dimensionality reduction techniques: two flavors of convolutional autoencoders and variational deep embedding (VaDE (Jiang, 2017)). While both methods show some degree of effectiveness at detecting outliers for most bird species datasets, we found significant variation in the performance of the methods from one species to the next. We believe that the results of this investigation demonstrate that the application of our cleaning process can meaningfully reduce the label noise of bird species datasets derived from Xeno-Canto audio repository but results vary across species.', 'authors': ['Bruce Collins'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'arXiv.org', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0080ab8f6cd86659fb137c7598b6e1278dec1ad2', 'external_ids': {'ArXiv': '2504.18650', 'DBLP': 'journals/corr/abs-2504-18650', 'DOI': '10.48550/arXiv.2504.18650', 'CorpusId': 278165882}, 'doi': '10.48550/arXiv.2504.18650', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617629', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPHMAAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPHMAAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0283ec-0000-0200-0000-689e79020000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216130}, {'id': 'e4e25755f49d74c8d89fe3aa292616a13f740cac5cfcf2f2c945be062645ca16', 'paper_id': '0080b436b671c79150c6336d2f513eeb99c292ce', 'title': 'Entropy-based methods for formulating bottom-up ultra-coarse-grained models.', 'abstract': 'Bottom-up coarse-grained (CG) modeling is an effective means of bypassing the limited spatiotemporal scales of conventional atomistic molecular dynamics while retaining essential information from the atomistic model. A central challenge in CG modeling is the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, as the inclusion of often pivotal many-body interaction terms in the CG force-field renders simulation markedly slower than simple pairwise models. The Ultra Coarse-Graining (UCG) method incorporates many-body terms through discrete internal state variables that modulate the CG force-field according to, e.g., changes in local environment when substantial chemical heterogeneities exist. However, assigning optimal internal states systematically from atomistic simulation data, as well as the practical application of bottom-up UCG theory to biomolecular systems, remain open problems. We develop two synergistic methods to aid in the development of UCG models that can capture inhomogeneities in atomistic systems such as those induced by phase coexistence. The first method establishes the systematic construction of UCG force-fields from a relative entropy minimization principle, while the second method utilizes machine-learning to obtain optimal local order parameters for enhanced model efficiency and transferability. We apply these methods to a methanol liquid-vapor interface and the ripple phase of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine lipid bilayer and demonstrate that UCG modeling alone recapitulates aspects of phase coexistence that are otherwise not observed in CG modeling.', 'authors': ['Patrick G.

We evaluate eight classification models: LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, HistGradientBoosting, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and TabNet, under three preprocessing settings: original feature space, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). The models are assessed on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC to examine both predictive performance and robustness. Ensemble methods, especially LightGBM and XGBoost, show the best overall performance across all configurations, with minimal sensitivity to PCA and consistent generalization. LDA improves KNN performance but significantly reduces accuracy for boosting models. TabNet, while promising in theory, underperformed under feature reduction, likely due to architectural sensitivity to input structure. The analysis is supported by detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA), including mutual information ranking, PCA or t-SNE visualizations, and outlier detection using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which confirm the discriminatory capacity of key features in the EMBER dataset.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the modification of PM2.5 on the associations of PA volume and intensity with depressive symptoms and glaucoma in individuals with or without depressive symptoms. Data of this study was obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) implemented during 2011 to 2020. PA volume and intensity were measured by a standardized questionnaire; a machine learning prediction model was applied to ascertain the PM2.5 concentrations. Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to explore associations. A total of 20,930 participants were finally included, with 11,214 analyzed for PA and depressive symptom risk and 16,965 analyzed for PA and glaucoma risk. PA volume or intensity was independent protective factor for incident depressive symptoms, while PM2.5 was independent risk factor for depressive symptoms and glaucoma in participants with or without depressive symptoms. Among participants with low PM2.5 exposure (<\\u200935 micrograms per cubic meter [¬µg/m3]), PA volume or intensity showed an inverse association with the risk of incident depressive symptoms, but insignificant associations between PA volume or intensity and glaucoma risk were observed in either participants with or without depressive symptoms.

The prevalence of chronic diseases, an aging population, and a rising need for efficient health management have put additional demands on healthcare to seek innovative solutions. This study discusses big data and AI integration to provide personalized healthcare services in smart cities. A quantitative research approach was implemented based on data from wearable devices, environmental sensors, and healthcare records. Health data analytics utilized machine learning algorithms, including decision trees and neural networks, to construct predictive models in the management of chronic diseases and early warning systems. Preprocessing and analysis of data were done using Python, R, and Hadoop to ensure accuracy and scalability. The AI models achieved an accuracy of 85% in the identification of early symptoms of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. A 20% increase in citizen satisfaction concerning healthcare services was noticed in those regions that implemented this model of AI-driven health management. Besides this, proactive alerts generated by the model resulted in a measurable decrease in the rate of progression of diseases, particularly in elderly populations. The results prove that AI can bring transformational changes to personalized healthcare in smart cities, in line with global research trends. These findings are academically significant in offering new methods of data analysis and are of practical value for policymakers in the design of efficient health management strategies. Limitations include regional bias and data privacy challenges.

This study proposes a novel hybrid model that integrates ResNet for spatial feature extraction, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for capturing temporal dependencies, and an Attention Mechanism to prioritize significant features. The model addresses key challenges such as class imbalance, scalability, and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns. Using the IEEE-CIS fraud detection dataset, the study demonstrates significant improvements in fraud detection performance. Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE) is applied to balance the dataset, ensuring the model effectively identifies rare fraudulent transactions while reducing false positives and negatives. Comparative analysis shows that the proposed framework achieves superior results, including a precision of 96%, recall of 92%, and an F1-score of 93.97%, outperforming benchmark models by a significant margin. The integration of attention mechanisms enhances interpretability, while advanced evaluation metrics like Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) provide insights into the model's decision-making process. The findings highlight the proposed model's potential as a robust, scalable, and interpretable solution for real-world credit card fraud detection. Recommendations for future research include expanding validation across diverse datasets, exploring advanced architecture like Transformers, and enhancing computational efficiency for real-time deployment. This study establishes a strong foundation for improving fraud detection systems and contributes to advancing machine learning methodologies in financial security applications.\", 'authors': ['I. A.

Scenarios included different gear engagements with one occupant and parked gear with up to four occupants. Motivated by security concerns, such as the threat posed by idling vehicles with multiple occupants, the research explores how micro-Doppler signatures can indicate vehicle readiness to move. Experiments focused on a mid-size SUV, with similar trends seen in other vehicles. Radar data were compared to in situ accelerometer measurements, confirming that the radar system can detect subtle frequency changes, especially during gear shifts. The system‚Äôs sensitivity enables it to distinguish variations tied to gear state and passenger load. Extracted features like frequency and magnitude show strong potential for use in machine learning models, offering a non-invasive, remote sensing method for reliably identifying vehicle operational states and occupancy levels in security or monitoring contexts. Spectrogram and PSD analyses reveal consistent tonal vibrations around 30 Hz, tied to engine activity, with harmonics at 60 Hz and 90 Hz. Gear shifts produce impulse signatures primarily below 20 Hz, and transient data show distinct peaks at 50, 80, and 100 Hz. Key features at 23 Hz and 45 Hz effectively indicate engine and gear states.

Soil samples with varying moisture and oil contents were prepared using typical silty clay from Nanjing and 0# diesel for both RCPTU tests and Wenner four-electrode resistivity experiments. The results demonstrate that resistivity decreases with increasing moisture content under constant oil conditions and increases with rising oil content under constant moisture conditions.

Then, representative single model (ANN) and integrated model (XGBoost) algorithms were selected to predict the dataset, and their performance was evaluated based on three commonly used regression evaluation metrics. Finally, the prediction accuracy of the ML model was further verified by comparing it with the domestic and foreign design codes. The results manifest that the shear capacity exhibits a strong positive correlation with the beam width and effective height. Compared to the ANN model, the XGBoost-based prediction model achieves determination coefficients (R2) of 0.999 and 0.879 for the training and test sets, respectively, indicating superior predictive accuracy.

One of the most significant applications of deep learning in IVF laboratories is the grading and selection of embryos for implantation. But recently, oocyte is gaining more interest in the context of fertility preservation and oocyte donation. The development of reliable models to predict blastocyst development from a single image of metaphase II oocyte may improve the counselling and management of fertility preservation cycles as well as oocyte donors and recipients.\\n \\n \\n \\n This study aimed to develop a model for good-quality blastocyst development prediction using non-invasive imaging of fresh metaphase II oocytes. A dataset of 747 oocyte images with an imbalanced class distribution (70%blastocyst, 30%non-blastocyst) was used. Images collected from one clinic required patient-wise data separation to ensure meaningful evaluation. Preprocessing included grayscale conversion, normalization to [0,1], resizing to 224\\u2009√ó\\u2009224pixels, and cross-validation with a stratified group k-fold split to maintain class balance and patient separation across folds\\n \\n \\n \\n The designed machine learning model is based on a modified pre-trained VGG16-architecture to benefit from transfer learning. The model was trained to distinguish oocytes likely to develop into blastocysts. The imbalance class distribution was addressed using Focal Loss, enabling the model to prioritize harder-to-classify images while balancing minority class gradients. The training involved two phases: classifier-only training (three epochs) and end-to-end fine-tuning (ten epochs). Augmentation techniques like image rotations, zoom, and intensity adjustments enhanced robustness.\\n \\n \\n \\n The preprocessing pipeline included grayscale conversion, normalization, and cross-validation with a stratified group k-fold split to ensure robust evaluation and prevent data leakage. Given the dataset‚Äôs small size, a data-centric approach was adopted, focusing on collecting high-quality oocyte images and cleaning to remove noise and artifacts, maximizing data utility and clinical relevance. The use of Focal Loss further addressed class imbalance, balancing sensitivity and specificity while prioritizing harder-to-classify cases.\\n Building on these mentioned methods, the model demonstrated strong predictive performance. Indeed, the model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.694, demonstrating good performance in predicting good quality blastocyst development (Grade A and B based on Gardner grading system). Sensitivity and specificity were balanced at 0.65 and 0.672, respectively, reflecting the model‚Äôs ability to handle the class imbalance. The negative predictive value (NPV) (non-blastocyst development) was 0.382, while the positive predictive value (PPV) (blastocyst development) reached 0.86, indicating superior performance in identifying good quality blastocyst development. These results were validated on an independent test set including 224 images with patient-wise separation, ensuring clinical relevance and mitigating potential data leakage. The balanced performance across sensitivity and specificity metrics supports the model‚Äôs potential as a non-invasive predicting support tool for embryologists and clinicians.\\n \\n \\n \\n The dataset included oocytes that developed into blastocysts and oocytes that did not reach the blastocyst stage, excluding other developmental outcomes. Data from a single clinic limits generalizability. Additionally, the relatively low PPV underscores the need for larger, multi-clinic datasets to validate the model‚Äôs robustness and clinical applicability.\\n \\n \\n \\n This study highlights the potential of AI in non-invasive oocyte quality evaluation, supporting professionals in counselling fertility preservation and IVF patients. By predicting good quality blastocyst development, the model is expected to reduce subjective assessment and improve the prediction of success rates.

However, dealing with straggler processes, which are sluggish running processes that raise the total response time, is a typical performance challenge in these kinds of systems. These kinds of jobs have the potential to have a substantial effect on the Quality of Service (QoS) provided by the system. It is necessary to have automatic straggler identification and mitigation systems that can complete jobs in a shorter amount of time in order to address this problem. Previous work often constructs reactive frameworks, the central emphasis of which is, in order, the identification, followed by the mitigation, of straggler tasks, that ultimately results in delays. Other research make use of prediction-based proactive systems, however they disregard the peculiarities of heterogeneous hosts or dynamic tasks. In this article, Hybrid Machine Learning (HML) is offered as a method that may determine which jobs are likely to be behind schedule and dynamically adjust scheduling in order to obtain faster response times. The method that has been suggested examines all tasks as well as hosts on the basis of the use of compute and network resources, and it is also able to predict and mitigate the effects of expected straggler activities. This speeds up the execution without lowering the quality of service. The proposed HML is evaluated in terms of quality of service factors such as energy usage, processing time, resource contention, and CPU utilisation in comparison to other machine learning methods that already exist, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), ADABOOST, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF). According to the results of several evaluations, the proposed HML cuts down on processing time, resource contention, and energy usage by 13.5%, 11.25%, and 16.75%, correspondingly, when compared to standard machine learning methodologies.

This study aims to analyses HeS in 27 non-EU European countries, identifying key priorities and trends, benchmarking against African and Eastern Mediterranean regions (EMR), and ranking and clustering health security performance to inform targeted interventions. Methods Utilizing 2019, 2021, and aggregated 2017‚Äì2021 data from six Global Health Security Index indicators, this study applied an integrated Entropy-CoCoSo-K-means framework. The Entropy method was employed to identify health security (HeS) priorities and trends in Non-EU countries, enabling cross-regional comparisons with African and EMR regions to highlight priority shifts and disparities. The Entropy-CoCoSo (Combined Compromise Solution) model generated dynamic rankings, while K-means clustering categorized countries into five risk clusters (high to dangerous). This integration facilitated cross-national dynamic rankings and cluster analyses, informing targeted interventions across Non-EU countries. Results Entropy analysis reveals that detection and reporting emerged as the most critical indicator (weight: 0.388), reflecting disparities in surveillance. The risk environment remains minimally influential (0.067), highlighting consistent vulnerabilities to external threats. Compliance with norms shows a sharp rise (0.091 ‚Üí 0.123), indicating emerging regulatory gaps or uneven adherence to health standards post-2019. Cross-regional comparisons highlighted a focus on detection and reporting in non-EU countries versus an emphasis on prevention in Africa and healthcare infrastructure prioritization in the EMR. Ranking and clustering revealed stark disparities: Armenia, Norway, and the UK consistently ranked ‚ÄúHigh,‚Äù In contrast, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Tajikistan (Cluster 5: ‚ÄúDangerous‚Äù) exhibited systemic weaknesses. Conclusion This study underscores the need for tailored policies to address non-EU Europe‚Äôs evolving HeS challenges. Harmonizing surveillance systems, scaling preventive measures, and bridging compliance gaps are critical. Regional collaboration and resource reallocation to low-performing nations are essential to mitigate disparities.', 'authors': ['M. N. Aljober', 'Adel A. Nasser', 'A. S. Alghawli', 'Amani A. K.

The parameters of these models and the cross-validation function are adjusted to each individual set of observations. This approach has not been researched in depth. We test it about class imbalance in the target variable. Our results demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method. First, parameter tuning of ML models can be an effective strategy to handle class imbalance. Second, random shuffling prior to cross validation can be a key to resolving the bias coming from multiclass imbalance. Another important finding is that the best results can be achieved when random shuffling, cross validation and parameter tuning are combined.

The main reason to diagnose these diseases is to ensure early intervention and appropriate quality of treatment to the patients. Owing to the datasets, this work propounds an automated solution for a multilabel lung disease classification based on the CNN and Transfer Learning empowered by the NIH Chest Xray Dataset. Accompanying the competition is the dataset of 112,120 chest X-ray images across 14 disease categories that provide a reliable ground for training and testing. The ResNet and DenseNet models were fine-tuned, and multiple diseases were classified, and class imbalance of the diseases was addressed through augmentation and weighted losses. The proposed model yielded an accuracy of $\\\\mathbf{9 4 \\\\%}$ as well as precision, recall, and F1 score higher than the recognized models such as CheXNet and traditional Machine Learning methods, including Random Forest and SVM. We also extended Grad-CAM for interpretability, which visually explained the important regions that affected the predictions, thus improving clinical relevance. The overall performance for common diseases was satisfying, although identification of especially rare forms of diseases such as pneumothorax and fibrosis proved difficult and carefully optimized through the Use of disease-specific measures. With CNNs and Transfer Learning, this study shows that traditional medical diagnostics could be revolutionized with scalable and efficient solutions that doctors can apply. Further work involves incorporating multiple modalities of clinical data and CT scans, as well as fine tuning the model for practical applications.

This review highlights recent progress in the use of neuroimaging‚Äîespecially functional MRI (fMRI)‚Äîand machine learning, both of which are playing a growing role in improving diagnostic accuracy and deepening our understanding of how the brain functions in ASD and FXS. By exploring the latest research, we show how these tools help uncover both unique and overlapping patterns in brain activity, laying the groundwork for earlier diagnosis and more personalized interventions. These developments point to the powerful potential of combining brain imaging and AI to transform the way we approach diagnosis and care.

Although improved risk stratification and tailored clinical management are urgently needed to enhance patient survival, such strategies remain limited. Methods We analyzed clinical and immunological data from 98 HIV-related cryptococcosis cases, employing machine learning techniques to model disease severity and predict survival outcomes. Our approach included unsupervised clustering, elastic net regularized Cox regression, and random survival forests. Model performance was rigorously assessed using the C-index, Brier score, Calibration and time-dependent AUC, with validation executed through a comprehensive, multi-replicated nested cross-validation framework. Results Through cytokine profiling, we identified an immune phenotype characterized by excessive inflammatory response (EXC), associated with greater disease severity, more frequent neurological symptoms, and poorer survival outcomes compared to the other two immune phenotypes, highlighting its potential significance in risk stratification. To further support clinical decision-making, we developed an elastic net regularized Cox regression model, achieving superior predictive accuracy with a mean C-index of 0.78 for 36-month outcomes and a mean Brier score of 0.13, outperforming both random survival forest and traditional Cox models. Time-dependent AUC analysis validated the model‚Äôs robustness, with AUC values of 0.84 at 12 months and 0.79 at 36 months, indicating its reliability and potential clinical utility. Discussion This study presents comprehensive and multidimensional approaches to overcome the challenges commonly encountered in real-world clinical settings. By applying cytokine-based clustering, we illustrate the potential for more nuanced severity stratification, offering a fresh perspective on disease progression. In parallel, our penalized survival model provides a step forward in personalized risk assessment, supporting informed clinical decisions and customized patient management. These findings suggest promising directions for individualized healthcare solutions, leveraging machine learning to enhance survival predictions in HIV-related cryptococcosis.', 'authors': ['Xuemin Fu', 'Luling Wu', 'Jingna Xun', 'Benno P√ºtz', 'Zhihang Zheng', 'Yanpeng Li', 'Yinzhong Shen', 'Hongzhou Lu', 'Jun Chen', 'B.

This work focuses on polyethylene polymers, the most widely used in the industry, with a particular emphasis on bio-polyethylenes, which align with sustainability goals by being derived from renewable materials such as biomass and agricultural crops, reducing dependence on fossil resources and minimizing the carbon footprint.\\nThe VICAT temperature is a key measure for evaluating the thermal resistance of thermoplastic materials, indicating the temperature at which they begin to soften under load. A higher VICAT temperature suggests better resistance to thermal deformation. A BioHDPE matrix, known for its high impact and tensile strength, suitable for demanding applications, was used.\\nTo improve mechanical and thermal properties, hemp fibers, almond powder, argan powder, and Halloysite nanotubes (HNT) were incorporated into the matrix, using organic waste to reduce costs. These components, available in the Mediterranean region, affect the VICAT temperature differently: hemp fiber and HNT enhance mechanical strength, while almond and argan powders may reduce it due to their tendency to decompose.\\nMachine learning (ML) techniques were applied to predict the VICAT temperature, aiming to reduce time and costs in the development of new materials. Regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Neural Networks (NN), Decision Trees (DT), and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), were compared, evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and the coefficient of determination (R¬≤). The best ML model was identified by a low MAPE and high R¬≤, ensuring high prediction accuracy.\\nThis study demonstrates the potential of ML in predicting material properties, contributing to the efficient and sustainable design of new polymers.\\n\\nKeywords: BioHDPE, Machine Learning, VICAT Temperature, Neural Networks, Prediction', 'authors': ['Manuel Llorca Alc√≥n', 'David GARCIA SANGUERA', 'Jordi Linares Pellicer'], 'year': 2025, 'venue': 'DYNA', 'citation_count': 0, 'url': 'https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a3390788448ee415a2cbdb13d196958ed20200', 'external_ids': {'DOI': '10.52152/d11211', 'CorpusId': 275294794}, 'doi': '10.52152/d11211', 'topic': 'machine learning', 'ingested_at': '2025-08-15T00:02:00.617870', '_rid': 'nw0sALzVQPH2AAAAAAAAAA==', '_self': 'dbs/nw0sAA==/colls/nw0sALzVQPE=/docs/nw0sALzVQPH2AAAAAAAAAA==/', '_etag': '\"5f0244ed-0000-0200-0000-689e79030000\"', '_attachments': 'attachments/', '_ts': 1755216131}, {'id': '97b24a8b0bace58a6501b761b8eea094cd79d7242121785c659d963d1334c8ec', 'paper_id': '00a340dce792a0e21fad0278e311c6a91fdaa170', 'title': 'Prediction of bloodstream infection using machine learning based primarily on biochemical data', 'abstract': 'Early diagnosis of bloodstream infection (BSI) is crucial for informed antibiotic use. This study developed a machine learning approach for early BSI detection using a comprehensive dataset from Rigshospitalet, Denmark (2010‚Äì2020). The dataset included 144,398 samples from adult patients, containing blood culture results, demographics, and up to 36 biochemical variables. Positive blood culture was observed in 6.4% of samples, mostly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. 80% of the samples (N\\u2009=\\u200943,351 patients) were used for ML model development and five-fold cross-validation, with 20% for independent testing (N\\u2009=\\u200910,837). Among seven models, LightGBM performed best, achieving an AUC of 0.69 on the test set. It was more accurate in detecting negatives, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.96 and specificity of 0.74, compared to a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.13 and sensitivity of 0.54. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified platelets, leukocytes, and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes as the top-3 predictive features. The model showed higher sensitivity (average 0.66) for common pathogens, e.g., 0.71 for E. coli. Results highlight the potential of biochemical variables as diagnostic factors for BSI, indicating clinical use to focus on identifying patients at low risks and can be further enhanced in future investigations.

It is very dangerous for humans. Even humans can also die. Most often develop when the human body is exposed to sunlight. In this case doctors can't identify easily because lots of diseases look like skin cancer like benign tumors. According to the Journal of cancer research and Therapeutics in India there are 0.5--4.8 among females and 0.04-6.2 among male skin cancer patients. Doctors are facing issues to identify skin cancer. It takes so much time. Many Researchers have developed different models for detecting skin cancer using machine Learning Algorithms and deep learning algorithms they got good accuracy also, but their algorithms running time is high that why they can't develop fast application and it's not easy to train new model. This paper presents a deep learning model for skin cancer detection and classification by using Extreme Learning Machine. This paper also develops a system software for users to detect skin cancers by clicking and selecting a picture. Users will have to click skin picture and select that image by the software and software will detect and classify that is benign or malignant.
